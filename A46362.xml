            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Hiſtorical Reflections ON COUNCILS; And particularly on the Council of <hi>TRENT:</hi> PROVING That Proteſtants are not Obliged to ſubmit thereto.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Believe it will by all men readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be granted, that ſince the firſt appearance of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there hath not hapned an Affair of greater moment than was the ſeparation of the Proteſtants from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which fell out in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt Century. It was a mighty rupture, that took whole States and Kingdoms from the <hi>Roman</hi> See. Schiſm is indeed one of the greateſt miſchiefs
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:99003:3"/>which can befall the Church; it is an enemy to Charity, nay, ruinous to it: and ſince Charity is no leſs neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Faith, Schiſm that deſtroys Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is no leſs to be feared than Hereſie that overthrows the Faith. In our preſent ſubject we find both Hereſie and Schiſm. The miſchief is great on either part. Thoſe of the ſeparation are Schiſmaticks, if they have not done it upon ſolid grounds. But if the Church from which they ſeparate hath given occaſion for ſuch ſeparation, and by her own errors made it abſolutely neceſſary; the guilt of the Schiſm falls then upon her. From hence ariſes a great conteſt, to know who it is that muſt one day anſwer before the Tribunal of God for this ſcandalous breach, that puts a ſtop to the progreſs of Chtiſtianity, ſowing among Chriſtians the ſeeds of variance and contention. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it to be a Cauſe already adjudged and determined: that famous Aſſembly the General Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who could not err, having pronounced de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitively upon it. By this Judgment, ſay they, men ought to abide: for there will elſe be no end of Controverſie. Diſputes ſhould not be everlaſting: but when the Judges have given their final Sentence, there can be no further proceeding. The
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:99003:3"/>Proteſtants are very far from thinking thus of the matter: they pretend a right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the Cauſe; they cry out againſt the incompetence of the Judge; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of undue and irregular proceedings; and will admit no other Deciſion of the truth and antiquity of their Religion than the Holy Scripture; as for Tradition, Councils, and Schools, by which they are condemned, they look upon them as things doubtful, falſified, falſe, and apt to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on illuſion and error. This Controverſie is moſt certainly of the greateſt importance; no leſs than eternal Salvation depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; ſo that it is the intereſt of all men to examine it to the bottom. It were a thing to be wiſhed, that we might plead our cauſe before a diſintereſſed Judge: but it cannot be. For all the ſincere and worthy perſons of <hi>Europe</hi> have already taken part on one ſide or the other: and thoſe that can ſtill ballance between the two Religions, are too ill Chriſtians to have the honour of being Judges in a Cauſe, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking is the Cauſe of God. But we entreat the Reader that at leaſt for a few hours he will lay aſide all manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, that he may ſo make the better Judgment of the force of our Arguments. My intention is not to enter into the depth of this vaſt matter, for that were to
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:99003:4"/>deſcend to particulars, and to examine the right and wrong of every diſpute. I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that the Proteſtants are not to be blamed for refuſing to ſubmit to the Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that from reaſons taken from the Council it ſelf. I will prove that it is not from giddineſs, nor from perverſeneſs; but from a juſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reſolution that they refuſe to ſubmit. For it ſeems reaſonable, that giving the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of this Council, we do alſo give an account why we conceive our ſelves not obliged to receive it.</p>

               <note place="margin">1. Firſt reaſon of not owning the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe it is a Party in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</note>In the firſt place the Reformed decline the juriſdiction of this Council, as a Judge incompetent, becauſe a Party. I eaſily foreſee I ſhall be ſtop'd ſhort here, and that it will be returned upon me, that the Churches being a Party, is the ordinary refuge of Hereticks. Had not the <hi>Arians</hi> as much right to tell the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> you are a Party, and therefore can be no Judge in the Cauſe? What! is not the Church obliged to maintain the rights of truth againſt Hereticks; and ſhall this ſhadow of a pretence be able to deprive her of the power to Judge? It is fit how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that we be heard in the matter: to ſee if there be not a mighty difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what we alledge for our ſelves, and what they are pleaſed to make the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:99003:4"/>ſay. The Church is certainly the prop and the pillar of truth, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; that is, ſhe is obliged to ſupport it. But yet Hereticks muſt not for that reaſon look upon the Church as a Party, and reject her as unfit to judge of religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. For Legiſlators, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantees of Laws, cannot juſtly be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as Parties, when they have no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in a matter in queſtion, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Laws. Were it reaſonable for a Murderer to harangue his Judges thus; <hi>Gentlemen, you cannot be my Judges, you have an intereſt in the proſecution, inaſmuch as you have forbidden to commit murder. It is an eaſie thing to foreſee what Judgment you will give, thus prejudiced as you are by your own Principles and Maximes. I demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fair and equal trial by Judges wholly free from all prepoſſeſſion.</hi> There could be nothing ſo ſenſeleſs as ſuch kind of talk: yet ſuch would be that of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who ſhould reject the judgment of the Church in Conteſts of this kind. Had the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> been the Council of the Church, and without other intereſt than to defend the truth, we might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from its Judgment had it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of any thing contrary to truth, but we could not have refuſed to own it as a Council. But we affirm, that the Council
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:99003:5"/>of <hi>Trent</hi> is not a Council of the Church, but of the Pope, and of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are our determined Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Controverſie. It is againſt the Pope that the Proteſtants contend; they diſpute his quality of Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, of ſupreme Head of the Church, of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge of Controverſies. By the dictates of common ſenſe, there is nothing ſo unjuſt, as to eſtabliſh him for Judge of a Cauſe, againſt whom the Suit is directly brought. But that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> was a Council of the Popes, not of the Church, is moſt apparent. For it was convened by him; he preſided in it; it conſiſted only of perſons who had taken an oath of fidelity to him, and were for the greater part his Penſioners. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was ſo much Maſter of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that it acted nothing but as inſpired or commanded by him. But it will be replied, that the Pope being the natural Head of the Church, and having the ſole right of convening Councils, and preſiding in them, he was not bound to lay aſide his Character in favour of the Proteſtants who unjuſtly attaqued him. Were a King, whoſe Sovereign Power ſhould by ſome perſons be diſputed, obliged to diveſt himſelf of his Royal Dignity, &amp; ſubmit it to the fantaſtick humours of men? The misfortune is that we
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:99003:5"/>are always peſter'd with ſimilies that have no manner of ſimilitude. A lawful Prince, whoſe rights are clear and indiſputable, I confeſs, were not obliged to renounce his Royal State. But a King whoſe rights were doubtful, falſe, and conteſted by a Prince of the Royal blond, and by the greateſt part of his Subjects, were obliged for the intereſts of peace to be content to ſit down as a private perſon, and ſuffer a Judgment of the validity of his Title. Is the Pope a Sovereign, whoſe rights are unqueſtionable? Is it acknowledged gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that he hath the ſole right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Councils, and preſiding in them; without whoſe Authority no Act paſſed therein ſhould be valid? So far from it, that the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world denies it. It is not believed by the Eaſtern Church, nor by the Churches of the North and South, or of the <hi>Greeks, Ethiopians, Cophties,</hi> or <hi>Ruſſians</hi> that their Councils are unlawful, becauſe the Pope doth neither convene them, nor preſide in them. The Proteſtants may be alſo reckoned for ſomething, not for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber only, but chiefly for their reaſons. For they bring a cloud of Witneſſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that the right of convening Councils belongs to the Emperours, and that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have not always
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:99003:6"/>preſided in them. The firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was called by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; and <hi>Alexander</hi> the then Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> did preſide in it. The ſecond Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council was called by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> at which neither the Pope, nor any of his Legates were preſent: and therefore cannot be ſaid to have preſided therein. There is nothing farther from truth,<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

On the contrary, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſed her ſelf, in all that ſhe was able, to what the Council had done.

<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:99003:6"/>reconciled with this Council. For <hi>Gregory</hi> affirms that this Council was not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Weſt. Yet after all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it paſſes ſtill for a lawful and General Council. To this I might add the third General Council aſſembled at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the fourth at <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the fifth and ſixth at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> all convened by the Emperours, and not by the Popes. I might add to all theſe, many other proofs of equal weight: but being fallen but by accident upon this Diſpute, I have no intention to enlarge farther upon the proofs. Yet I cannot but take notice, that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> being at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the year 553. when the fifth General Council was there held; he would not aſſiſt in it, nor did preſide therein, either in Perſon, or by his Legates: and yet the Council is received both for lawful and General. There is then already juſt cauſe to doubt, that the Pope hath ſuch a right of convening Councils and preſiding in them, as to render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful if called or managed by others. But this is not all; for a conſiderable part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church it ſelf hold this opinion to be moſt falſe, <hi>That the Pope hath the ſole right of convening General Councils, and preſiding in them.</hi> All the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and generally all that
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:99003:7"/>own the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil;</hi> that is to ſay, at leaſt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> are of this Judgment. The Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> could not be convened by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pope, for it aſſembled it ſelf at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the Chriſtian Princes, and by the authority of the College of Cardinals, for the depoſing of three Popes who were then ſitting; the one at <hi>Rome,</hi> being <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> XII. another at <hi>Bologna,</hi> being <hi>John</hi> XXIII. the third at <hi>Avignon,</hi> being <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. Not one of theſe Popes could preſide in this Council, being all thither cited, and there condemned as falſe Popes. The Cardinal of <hi>Cambray</hi> did preſide in the third Seſſion, Cardinal <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> in the fifth, <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia</hi> Cardinal and Vice-Chancellour of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church preſided in the ſeventh, and in all the reſt, till the Election of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> V. <hi>John</hi> XXIII. being depoſed, and retired, the Council declared in the third Seſſion, <hi>That by the departure of the Pope the Council was not diſſolved, but did ſtill continue in its full authority.</hi> In the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil,</hi> Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. could not poſſibly preſide, for he was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and depoſed, and <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> elected in his ſtead. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth Seſſion the ſame Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that during the abſence of the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:99003:7"/>Preſidents, the firſt Prelate ſhall have the right of preſiding without waiting for the Popes Commiſſion. This one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine doth not ſeem to import, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil muſt be only under the direction of a Pope, or of thoſe that are Commiſſioned by him. I am not Ignorant that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Councils both of <hi>Baſil</hi> and of <hi>Conſtance</hi> are had in extreme horror by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I know alſo that that doth not hinder, but that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and divers others do receive and approve them. And that ſuffices to ſhew, that the rights of the Pope were not ſo clear and unconteſted but that for the ſake of peace he might well remit them to be examined and ſetled by a free Council: and that by conſequence, upon his refuſing to do it, the Proteſtants have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as a Party and an Adverſary in the Controverſie, that Council that the Pope hath convened, wherein he preſided, and over which he reigned with abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.<note place="margin">That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having once given Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; and an Appeal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought, ſhe could not proceed to a ſecond Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But to evince more plainly this truth, <hi>That the Proteſtants have reaſon to conſider the Council of Trent as their Adverſe Party;</hi> it is to be remarked that the matters in queſtion were not novel, but for the greater part had been already decided ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Councils, or by Papal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:99003:8"/>or by a Cuſtom univerſally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had decreed the adoration of Images. Tranſubſtantiation, the Real Preſence, adoration of the Sacrament, Auricular Confeſſion, had been paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Laws by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. in the fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lateran,</hi> held in the year 1215. The Cup in the Sacrament was taken from the Laity by Decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> held in the year 1414. Purgatory, and the ſeven Sacraments, were made Articles of Faith by the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> in the years 1438, and 1439. In a word, there was ſcarce any of the controverted Points that had not been decided. All that the Proteſtants did, amounted to no other, than an endeavour to be relieved from the hardſhips of Judgments already given. Truly and properly ſpeaking, they were Appellants from the Deciſions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church to the Holy Scripture. How great was then the injuſtice, to ſet up that Church for Judge of a Cauſe againſt which ſhe had already given Judgment, and from which Judgment the Proteſtants had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed? When there ariſe new and doubtful matters in a Church, there is no doubt but that Church hath a right to Judge of them, and to aſſemble her Councils to that end. For inſtance, in the time of
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:99003:8"/>
               <hi>Berengarius</hi> the diſpute about the Real Preſence was revived, which had lain bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in forgetfulneſs ſince <hi>Bertrand</hi> and <hi>Paſchaſius.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having not as then decided the matter, <hi>Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had no reaſon but to hear the Judgment of the Church, having firſt done all in him, in order to the prevalence of truth. Had the Church decreed unjuſtly in the matter, he might then have refuſed to acquieſce in the Judgment: for that the Conſcience cannot ſubmit, but where it is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the Deciſion is in conformity to the Word of God. But when a Church hath once pronounced upon a matter, and an Appeal be rightly made, ſhe hath then certainly no power to give a ſecond Sentence in the ſame Cauſe; or if ſhe doth, no conſequence as of a new Condemnation can be juſtly drawn from it. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had already paſſed her Decree upon the Points in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, before the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> we muſt look upon her as a Judge become a Party, as having long before declared againſt the truth. But can it in conſcience be thought, that the Prelates aſſembled at <hi>Trent</hi> came thither with intent to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, whether the natural Body of Chriſt be in the Euchariſt? whether the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall have the Worſhip of <hi>Latria?</hi>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:99003:9"/>Were they not reſolved already, ere they came to <hi>Trent?</hi> Came they not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condemn the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any inquiſition after truth? Had they not almoſt all an implacable hatred to the Proteſtants? Did they not ſolicit Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to deſtroy them with Fire and Sword? And are theſe qualifications to be deſired in Judges? If it be asked, how then the Aſſembly ſhould have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have given content to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants? I anſwer, it ſhould have been as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> deſired it. The Biſhops ſhould have been abſolved from their Oaths of fidelity to the Pope. The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> did it in a time when there was leſs need than when the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſate. The Proteſtant Divines ſhould have been called, the more moderate perſons of each party ſhould have been choſen, the Biſhops ſhould have been prevailed with to lay aſide all paſſion and prejudice, the truth ſhould have been ſought with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mind, and the Word of God been only conſulted for it. The one might have hoped that perſons ſo qualified, by ſuch a conduct might have reached the truth.</p>

Second cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> tho it were duly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, in could not be infallible.</note> yet were we in no ſort obliged to receive and comply with all her Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with an abſolute reſignation and a blind credulity: to which nothing can move one but the fond ſuppoſition of the infallibility of Councils. Not to deſcend to an Examen of the particular faults of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it is impoſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ones ſelf that a Council, that is to ſay, an Aſſembly, in which there is no Prophet, nor any man inſpired of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, is not liable to err; and for my part I very much queſtion whether there be in the world any one perſon that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thinks ſo. I will admit that to have recourſe to an infallible living Judge would be of high importance to the World. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtrongly ſupports her ſelf by the artifice of poſſeſſing the People with the belief of her infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>But when it comes to be enquired where it is that this infallibility doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, one knows not where to find it. Some place it in the Pope alone, others in the Council alone, and a third ſort in Pope and Council united. Thoſe that place it in the Councils ſeem to have greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than ſuch as would fix it to the perſon of the Pope. For Councils are indeed the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:99003:10"/>undoubted Judges of controverſies in the Church: So that if there be any infallible Judge in the Church, it ſhould be them. As it certainly is moſt probable that the wiſdom of many in conjunction ſhould be of greater prevalence and purity, than that of any ſingle perſon. The Pope, whoſe Authority is meer Uſurpation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an infallible Judge, nor hath God given to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> any power to judge of controverſies in the name of the Catholick Church. Yet after all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo much to favour the Councils, it muſt be confeſſed that the opinion that fixes the infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon the Pope, is much eaſier to defend, than that which aſcribes it to the Council. For this latter opinion that makes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to be infallible is perhaps the moſt vain and empty Notion that was ever ſtarted. I paſs the proofs brought from Scripture for each opinion: they are much of an equal weight. The Text, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not,</hi> is as good a proof of the Popes infalliblility; as is this, <hi>Where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> to prove that Councils are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.<note place="margin">That Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils came into the world but by accident.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But if we conſult the light of reaſon and common ſenſe, can any one endure
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:99003:10"/>to ſee infallibility aſcribed to theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that they call General Councils; things which have either never been at all, or rarely, and by accident? For as to Dioceſan, Provincial, and National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, the pretence of infallibility reaches not to them. Let us then reflect a little, that theſe General Councils were not known in the Church till the converſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is the firſt of theſe Emperours. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> held in the year 325. is the firſt of theſe General Councils: that is to ſay, that for three hundred years together the Church had no ſuch thing as an infallible Judge. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays very well, that the Church having continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out General Councils for three hundred years, might as well have done ſo for three hundred more, or even for ſix, or for nine hundred. Or it may be it was becauſe there was in thoſe days no need of any Council, there were then either no Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or none that openly contended with the Church; but a ſpirit of meekneſs and ſubmiſſion prevailed among all Believers. So far from it, that Satan did never ſight againſt the truths of the Goſpel, nor poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Chriſtendom with more or greater He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, than in thoſe times. The works of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:99003:11"/>of many others of the Fathers, do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew it. Let us know a little, where reſted this infallible ſpirit during the three firſt Centuries; if it be true that it is only to be found in General Councils; there having been none during all that time. But the Church poſſibly was not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Could it be ever made out, that infallibility were one of the priviledges of the Church, it were much more tolerable to allow it to a See that hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſupplied with an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops, as that of <hi>Rome:</hi> And it falls more readily under our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things, for the Holy Ghoſt ſo to inſpire and guide ſome one particular perſon, than a numerous Aſſembly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the greater part of the members that compoſe it are very often either counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Chriſtians, or men of reſtleſs and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent minds. I think it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of our remark, that theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which they are pleaſed to entitle General Councils, have been but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent introduced into the Church. It is the converſion of the Emperours that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned them. Let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours had continued Pagan, as it was very poſſible; there had been then no means of aſſembling the Clergy of the whole Chriſtian world; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:99003:11"/>the Church had been always abandoned to a ſpirit of Error. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Emperours would never have ſuffered the Chriſtians from all parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and of the world it ſelf, to have met together in a body, and united in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; they would have been jealous that the publick ſafety might have been endangered from ſuch kind of Aſſemblies. It is therefore evident that the converſion of the Emperors gave occaſion to them; and for that reaſon, that they are but accidental things. But this will be yet more clear, if we farther ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what might alſo very well have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that when the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours became Converts to the faith of Chriſt, they had loſt the greateſt part of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and retained no more than <hi>Italy,</hi> or ſome leſs conſiderable Province. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that in ſuch caſe they could not have aſſembled the Clergy of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World. For the neighbouring Princes at enmity with them, would never have permitted the Biſhops ſubject to them to tranſport themſelves into an enemies Country; leſt they might there be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to revolt and ſhake off the Dominion of their new Maſters. From all which it is moſt apparent, that it was very poſſible that there might never have been any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council known in the Church, and
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:99003:12"/>that what hath been is purely by accident. But ſuch things as are ordained of God for preſervation of the truth, cannot be ſaid to have fallen out by accident. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, according to the order of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the Government of the Church, Councils were deſigned to judge infallibly of Controverſies; why hath it not pleaſed God to remove thoſe obſtructions that hindred the forming of theſe Councils under the Pagan Emperours? For tho it is true that jealouſie of State might have proved a powerful obſtacle; yet it is as true that as great difficulties have been ſurmounted. All time were not alike averſe to Chriſtianity. There have been among the Heathen Emperours ſome that were favourable to it: and what could not have been done at one time, might have been effected at another, nevertheleſs this deſign of a General Council came never into any mans head till <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Was it ever known, for the firſt three hundred years together, that the Biſhops had any intent of aſſembling from all parts of the World? Or is it ſo much as read in any Author, that they complained for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to do it? If it be true that theſe Aſſemblies are the unerring Guides of the Church, the Fathers of the three firſt Centuries could not be ignorant of it: if
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:99003:12"/>they knew it, it was a moſt ſupine and wretched negligence not to uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt efforts for the aſſembling theſe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judges, to have put an end to the many differences that then diſquieted the Church: or if they found it abſolutely impoſſible for them to convene them, it is yet a ſtrange inſenſibility never ſo much as to lament the affliction of ſuch an incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Preſcriptionibus</hi> tells us all the ſeveral methods by him conceived moſt proper for convincing of Hereticks. What an aſtoniſhing thing is it, that he ſhould not ſpeak one word of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by General Councils, a way ſo ſure, ſo ready, ſo infallible! It muſt certainly be, that the Fathers never dreamt of theſe infallible Judges. I conclude therefore, that to deal ſincerely one muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the zeal of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did alone occaſion that Aſſembly that is called the firſt General Council, and by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of which the reſt were formed. For the better determining a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie he was deſirous to convene as many Biſhops as he could; even all that were in the large extent of his vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that ſo their Deciſion might be the more ſolemn and efficacious. And this is the original of General Councils. The Chriſtian Emperours called together the
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:99003:13"/>Biſhops from all parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. That Empire was called, in the ſtile not of the Church only, but of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles alſo, the whole world, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have taken from thence the name of General or Univerſal Councils. When the parts that made up this mighty Body the Empire came to ſeparate, and to be formed into ſeveral diſtinct States &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> puts himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperors place; and by pretending a ſpiritual power ſtill retains thoſe ſeveral States and Kingdoms in a ſpiritual juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, that were only at firſt obliged by the temporal power of the Emperours. By this means he continues to aſſemble the Biſhops of thoſe ſeveral States, and to term ſuch Aſſembly a general Council. Let any diſcerning perſon judge, whether theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies thus formed by accident, as is moſt apparent, can be veſted with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of infallibility.<note place="margin">There never were any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that could truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led General Councils.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, it is a great abuſe of words to give the name of Oecumenical or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council to a Convention of two or three hundred Biſhops out of five or ſix Nations.<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vita Conſtant. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>

It is certain that theſe diſtant Churches ſent not their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to the Councils that were held in Countrys ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. A Council that might deſerve the name of General, ought at leaſt to be compoſed of the Guides of the Church, of all the Learned, and of all thoſe that have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſtudied the myſteries of Religion. There is no place in the world could hold ſuch an Aſſembly, nor were it poſſible to deliberate in it. But, alas! inſtead of the prodigious number of Guides and Paſtors of the Catholick Church, a very few, and thoſe almoſt all of the ſame Nation, are, it ſeems, enough to make a General Council. For it is certain, that the Provinces near
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:99003:14"/>the place where the Council is celebrated do ſupply it with more Biſhops and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, than all the more remote Kingdoms put together: and yet this ſcrap of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil muſt paſs for the Univerſal Church, muſt be ſuppoſed to be acted by her Spirit, and endued with her infallibility: Than which there was never certainly a more vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Certain it is, that there hath as yet been nothing that can be truely ſtiled a General Council. The ancient Councils had the name of General for that they were in time generally owned by the Church. The ſecond General Council conſiſted of but 150 Biſhops, and thoſe only of the Provinces neighbouring to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The latter Councils are compoſed of yet ſewer Nations: there are only a few <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Spaniards, French,</hi> and ſome <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> but neither the North, the South, the Eaſt, nor the greateſt part of the Weſt are concerned in them. I would very fain learn, why the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church ſhould not be infallible, ſhould ſhe form an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of a thouſand Divines, as ſhe eaſily may, and yet becomes infallible when joyned to <hi>Germans, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi> It is a myſtery beyond comprehenſion. It were fit to produce good proofs for the eſtabliſhment of this infallibility of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; or at leaſt to ſhew they are in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:99003:14"/>of it by a Series of examples without interruption. As for ſuch proofs, they ought to be out of the Holy Scripture. But I ſhall not ſtand to examine or conteſt the proofs, for that were to enter into Theological diſputes; whereas we intend here no more than Hiſtorical Reflections: and ſuch we cannot omit as we conceive will overthrow the infallibility of Councils.</p>

               <note place="margin">That many General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſo called, have actually erred.</note>Thoſe that maintain the infallibility of theſe Aſſemblies, that they are pleaſed to ſtile General Councils, would do well to make out this Aſſertion of theirs from Hiſtory.

            <p>
               <hi>Zozimus</hi> produced a Canon, as of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which permitted Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to <hi>Rome:</hi> Tho it was not really a Canon of that Council, but of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Sardica.</hi> The <hi>Africans</hi> were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at it, and knew not on the ſudden what to reply; for in their Copies of the Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> there was no ſuch Canon to be found; ſo that not knowing from whence it might be taken, becauſe they knew nothing of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Sardica,</hi> or its Canons; there was

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſacius,</hi> had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced contrary to the Faith of the Church; but were again perfectly returned from their error, and had each of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt the Confeſſion of Faith made by the Council of <hi>Ariminuw.</hi> We have thus already five General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that have erred about the ſame matter.</p>
            <p>In the Cauſe of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the two Natures of Chriſt, there were two General Councils aſſembled. The firſt was at <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the year 449. convened by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, a Prince truly Catholick. All the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were preſent at it; <hi>Juvenal</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Jeruſalem, Dioſcorus</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Domnus</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Flavian</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and by his Legats <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nothing was wanting to the Legality or Univerſality of this Council. For to ſay that this Council was Illegal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not convened by the Pope, and that
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:99003:17"/>the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and not the Popes Legates did preſide therein, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vain Allegation, the weakneſs of which however in this place we are not concerned to ſhew. For we oppoſe not ſuch as make the Pope Superiour to Councils, and all the Authority of Councils to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Popes Pleaſure. We oppoſe ſuch as make the Council Superiour to the Pope, and hold a Council to be nothing the leſs legal, or leſs infallible for not being under the Popes direction; ſuch as look upon the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and of <hi>Baſil</hi> as moſt holy Councils, tho the Popes did not preſide in them; and ſuch in fine as require us to ſubmit to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> upon its own Authority. This General Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> tho legally aſſembled, and according to the Canons, is notwithſtanding a deteſtable Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that juſtified the Heretick <hi>Eutiches,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his Doctrine, and depoſed <hi>Flavian</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a moſt holy and Orthodox perſon. About nineteen years, before there had been held another General Council at the ſame City of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> in the Cauſe of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was to Perſons in Chriſt. This Hereſie was there condemned, and Truth triumphed. This certainly makes an eſſential difference between theſe two
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:99003:18"/>Councils; tho otherwiſe there be none that I can ſee as to Form and Externals: unleſs that Error was victorious in the ſecond Council with leſs ſcandal than truth overcame in the firſt. For it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> Preſident of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> did with much facility cauſe the Hereſie of <hi>Eutiches</hi> to prevail; the Popes Legats, and ſome few others, having been only a little roughly treated: whilſt in the firſt Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which is the third received Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, there was a horrible Schiſm occaſioned by <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who made Parties, and depoſed each other.<note place="margin">Socrat. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi> Evagrius. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> The Emperour was forced to interpoſe in the matter, and to make uſe of his Authority to appeaſe ſo dreadful a Sedition. It is apparent from all theſe Conſiderations, that tho the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could be conſidered as a General Council, that would not bind us to believe it infallible, nor to ſubmit blindly to its Deciſions.</p>

               <hi>Trent,</hi> nor any of thoſe held in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſince the Schiſm of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, would have no right to pretend to this priviledg of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility. The Schiſm of thoſe two Churches fell out in the tenth Century, beginning indeed toward the end of the ninth; ſince that time the <hi>Greek</hi> Church hath had no Communion with the <hi>Latin.</hi> It is true, there have been ſeveral attempts to re-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them, but without ſucceſs. So that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have had no Voice in the <hi>Latin</hi> Councils, nor the <hi>Latins</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Councils, for ſix or ſeven hundred years. The Church of the <hi>Latins</hi> is not near half of the Chriſtian Church: yet ſhe will needs have it that hers are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils; whileſt the Councils of the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches muſt paſs forſooth but for little Conſults or a ſort of Conventicles. It is a prodigious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity for a Church ſcarce more than a fourth of the Chriſtian World to ſet up it ſelf for the Univerſal Church, and to count the reſt for nothing. All the Churches of the <hi>Eaſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, the Church of the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> who poſſeſs all <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which is a large ſhare of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> are, ſay they, Schiſmatical Aſſemblies; they have broken the bands of Union with the
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:99003:19"/>Head which is the Pope, and are no longer worthy of the name of Churches: for there are no true Chriſtians but thoſe that are ſubject to the Holy See, which is the band of Unity. This indeed is an excellent Principle. According to this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> all the Chriſtians in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi> and in the <hi>North</hi> are condemned to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Perdition. What can be imagined ſo cruel as this Tenet? I cannot for my part believe that there is any reaſonable Man of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion that dares ſeriouſly affirm, that an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Chriſtians believing in Jeſus Chriſt and receiving the Canons of the Ancient Councils, are yet in a ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, only for not acknowledging the Papal Supremacy. I know very well that this Doctrine is taught: but I appeal to the Conſcience of thoſe that teach it, and am fully perſwaded that they cannot but inwardly grant, that ſuch Perſons may be ſaved out of the Pope's Communion. And were but that Point as openly confeſſed as it is ſecretly owned, they muſt then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to acknowledg that the Councils of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are no General Councils. For if the <hi>Greeks</hi> may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; it is becauſe the Church of which they are Members is a true Church; ſince all Men acknowledg, that out of the Church
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:99003:19"/>there is no Salvation.

The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was but a part even of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church.</note>The nearer approaches we make to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the more plainly we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the imperfections that ruine its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Proteſtants. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen, that this Council is their adverſe Party in the Cauſe; that granting it a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, it could not be infallible; that yet it is not a General Council, for that three parts of the Chriſtian Church have no part in it: it follows, that it is then at moſt but a Council of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But, alas, it is not ſo much as a General Council even of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. It is a Council of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the <hi>Italians:</hi> it is a Council of ſome ſixty odd Biſhops, whereof many were the Pope's Penſioners. This Council was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled three ſeveral times: the firſt time under <hi>Paul</hi> III. the ſecond time under <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the 3d. the third time under <hi>Pius</hi> IV. In the two firſt, there were not above ſixty Biſhops preſent, almoſt all <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Italians.</hi> Where then is the Univerſality of a Council conſiſting of ſo few Perſons? Yet have theſe few adventured to decide
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:99003:20"/>the moſt important Matters. There were ſixteen Seſſions held, during the two firſt Convocations; wherein were decided the Controverſies of the <hi>Scripture, Tradition, Original Sin, Grace, Juſtification, Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt, Penance, Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Sixty Perſons undertake to give Laws to all the Conſciences of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, and in things not underſtood by them. They muſt needs be very blind, whoſe Faith can truckle to the Deciſions of ſo ſmall a number of Men, of ſo little Underſtanding. <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th. was very much in the right to ſay, as he often did, that it was great folly to ſend ſixty trifling Biſhops to the Mountains, and imagine that they muſt preſently have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of diſcerning the Truth, rather than the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> where there is always ſo great a number of excellent Perſons who make the Study of Divinity the ſole buſineſs of their Life. I muſt confeſs indeed that there were above two hundred Prelats preſent at the third Convocation of the Council. But how? There came ſome fifteen or twenty from <hi>France,</hi> and not till about the end neither. There was yet a few more <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But no <hi>Germans,</hi> no <hi>Polonians,</hi> no <hi>Hungarians;</hi> or if there were, it was ſo very few, as could never be thought to repreſent the Nations. For it was one of
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:99003:20"/>the Policies of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to permit to Vote by Nations, nor that the abſent Biſhops might Vote by Proxy, and that each Biſhop ſpake only for himſelf. There might be about fifty or ſixty or ſome few more <hi>French, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops; the reſt were <hi>Italians,</hi> and that reſt were three parts of four, for there was more than one hundred and fifty. Not the <hi>Lutherans</hi> only, but all <hi>Europe</hi> agreed in it, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Italian,</hi> a Papal Council.</p>

The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to the Proteſtants,</note>If we regard the conduct of this Council, we find from thence another reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. Already we have taken notice with what heat and violence that Council acted againſt thoſe over whom it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Judg. It hath frequently quitted the quality of Judge, to aſſume that of being the adverſe Party; and ſuch a Party as cared not to exceed all the bounds of honour and good Faith. The Deſign of making odious the Doctrine of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> was apparently the reigning Paſſion of the Council. For it countenanced the falſe extracts made of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> books; and made Hereſie of the moſt trivial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: all the wild Opinions of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Sectaries were imputed to them. Nor was any difficulty made of open and manifeſt contradictions, in order to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:99003:21"/>the Doctrine of the Proteſtants in hideous colours. Sometimes they were made <hi>Pelagians,</hi> denying Original Sin: ſometimes of the Sect of the <hi>Manichees</hi> who denied Free Will. Yet is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo wide and remote as are the two Hereſies of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees.</hi> Man by this laſt Sect was deprived of all his freedom; and by the other Free Will was eſtabliſhed upon the ruines of Grace. But with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the End, it ſeems, which was the blacken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Proteſtants, was enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the baſeſt and vileſt Means. If there was any that had ſo much remaining ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, as to interpret the Proteſtant Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a little favourably, there was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate exclamation of Hereſie! Hereſie! Was any thing fair to be expected from ſuch a ſort of Judges? But indeed, what other procedure could be expected from a Council compoſed as this? The Judges were Biſhops, and the Advocates were Monks: both which by their particular intereſts were the implacable Enemies of the Proteſtants. The Biſhops ſaw plainly, that nothing leſs than their abſolute ruine was threatned: that the reforming of their ſoftneſs, their Luxury, and the pravity of their Manners, would not alone ſuffice; but that a reduction of their vaſt Revenues, their
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:99003:21"/>large Dioceſes, and their Deſpotique Sway over the Church and Clergy was no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. That it was endeavoured to bring them down to plain Paſtors, or at leaſt to ſubject them to their Clergy, and to take away that Pomp, that Wealth and Power they ſo much idolize, Let any one judg what kind of Sentiments they muſt needs have for thoſe that deſigned them ſo much ill. As for the Monks, who explained mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and pleaded before the Biſhops againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they looked upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as upon a ſort of people that had reſolved their ruine, and the ruine of all Monaſteries; that would have all the Wealth and Revenues reſtored back that theſe Religious Houſes enjoyed under a pretence of Piety. They ſtrove out of Revenge to make the <hi>Lutherans</hi> odious: For they well knew the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did not ſpare them, but openly accuſed their Vows, of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; their ſeeming Sanctity, of deep Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; their Houſes, of being ſinks of filth and Impurity; their Retreats, of being places where Men are nouriſhed in Sloth, and in a ſort of life that ſhrouds under a Veil of Auſterity the greateſt ſoftneſs and Luxury. He is little acquainted with humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that knows not how mightily the motives of Intereſt and Revenge do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the Mind, and depreſs Reaſon. I do
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:99003:22"/>not therefore wonder at the implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Council to the Proteſtants; I ſhould rather wonder had it been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: but I affirm that this known and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Hatred gave juſt cauſe to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to reject the Council.</p>

It was not a free Council.</note>But could the Council have clear'd it ſelf of this Hatred taken up both by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and inclination, yet the Proteſtants could have looked for no good from it; for that it was the ſlave, the creature of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and wholly depended on it. This is ſo very notorious, that to deny or to queſtion it, is to loſe all ſenſe of ſhame and modeſty. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> complained of it highly. Theſe complaints were made publickly, in the face of the World, diſcourſed, written, and repeated daily, and in various forms as in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ſhall be ſhown. Nothing was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Council but by the Pope's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and by the mouth of his Legats: nor did it determine of any thing, but by the expreſs direction of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> When difficulties were found in any Affair, ſo that it went no juſt as the Legats would, but thwarted a little the Papal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; the Preſidents of the Council ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted ſpecious pretences to procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate the matter: and theſe delays were
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:99003:22"/>purely to gain time to conſult the Pope's pleaſure in the buſineſs; and to know in what manner it ſhould be decided; and this was called, a giving time for allaying Mens Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that ſo the Holy Ghoſt might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Maſter of their Minds, and might govern their Reſolutions. When the Pope's Orders were arrived, the Preſidents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their Penſioners in Caballing and ſecret working of the matter; but if thoſe Intrigues miſcarried, the buſineſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to another Seſſion. But if no Arts would do, they took off the Maſque, and plainly told the Council, that ſuch was the Pope's pleaſure. Beſides, the Pope had in the Council under the management of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> five or ſix rude tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, who abuſed and affronted any Man, making hideous noiſes by kicking and ſtriking the Benches with Hands and Feet, upon the delivering of an Opinion that did not pleaſe them. Nay, theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious men came frequently to reproachful Revilings, and even to Blows. Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> himſelf tells us, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>della Cava,</hi> one of theſe ſo diſorderly Perſons, did one day box another Biſhop, and tore away part of his Beard, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with ſome freedom delivered his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. The Biſhop of <hi>Aliſta,</hi> who was maintaining that Biſhops were inſtituted
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:99003:23"/>by Chriſt, was interrupted by Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> with, <hi>Be ſilent, inſolent Man, and let others ſpeak.</hi> If any Man was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhed for maintaining Opinions contrary to the <hi>Italian</hi> Theology, he was either, wearied by rudeneſs and ill treatment, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beg leave to retire, or made to be recalled by his Superiours, if he had any; or otherwiſe plainly driven from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. When <hi>Pius</hi> IV. was reproached with the little liberty he gave the Biſhops in that Council; he onely excuſed it, by retorting upon Princes, that they left them yet leſs liberty than he did. To deal tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what the Pope ſaid was not altogether groundleſs: for the poor Biſhops were the Slaves of Princes, as well as of the Pope. The Pope himſelf made uſe of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes, to reſtrain the over for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of ſome Prelats. Thus he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Letters from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and from the Marqueſs <hi>de Peſcara</hi> his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour at the Council and Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelats from favouring ſuch as were deſirous to ſet bounds to the Papal Power. From what happened in the Diſputes about the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Power of Biſhops by Divine Right, it is eaſie to conjecture what would have happened had the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Tenents found Partiſans in the Council. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
               <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:99003:23"/>the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Councils declaring the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Juriſdiction of Biſhops to be <hi>jure divino:</hi> they had their particular Intrigue in it, as the courſe of this Hiſtory will ſhew. But the Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> lay in direct oppoſition, and that the Point might not be decided in favour of the Biſhops. To effect which, no ſtone was left unturned, no means untried, that Artifice, Violence and Tyranny could make uſe of. What then had been done, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what had not been done, if, as the Proteſtants deſired, the Pope's. Authority had been directly ſtruck at, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his Grandeur openly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had but only offered at what was actually done by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that is the declaring of the Pope to be ſubject to the Council; the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would rather have ſet all Chriſtendom in confuſion, that have ſuffer'd it. The Preſidents had expreſs Orders, if that Point came at all into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, immediately to break up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and return to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               </list> Theſe are the principal Points diſputed in <hi>France.</hi> Thoſe that tend to

Between both, this Council as enacting contrary to the Rights and Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, was never at all received in <hi>France,</hi> ſo as to obtain the force of a Law. Why then ſhould that Aſſembly give Law to us Proteſtants, that is reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by ſo great a part of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> If it hath not erred, why do <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks (as they will be termed) refuſe to receive it? And if it hath erred, what reaſon is there to preſs us to receive it? I know what is anſwered to this: that matters of Faith and of Diſcipline muſt be diſtinguiſhed; that the Council did not, nor could not err in matters of Faith and Doctrine, and that it was only miſtaken in points of Diſcipline. But we ſhall find this Anſwer to be a great Illuſion. Firſt of all, it is very hard to comprehend why the Church ſhould be indued with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit only in points of Doctrine, and not in matters that ſhould eſtabliſh Order and Government. For certainly it is of the Eſſence of the Church to be governed according to the intention of
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:99003:26"/>God, and of Chriſt, as certainly as it is Eſſential to it to be guided in all Truth. Suppoſe it impoſſible to retain all the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Truths, and therefore that Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Confuſion, and Diſorder become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent: what ſort of Church ſhould we have? But the better to diſſipate this Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is to be obſerved, that there is no Point of Diſcipline, but hath a ſtrict Union with ſome Point of Right: and that there are ſome Points of Diſcipline that are Points of Doctrine likewiſe, and of the firſt Claſs too. For example, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, the diſpoſition of that great and mighty Clergy, diſtinguiſhed into Prieſts, Biſhops, Arch biſhops, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Primates, over whom is placed their great Head, whom they intitle Chriſts Vicar and Lieutenant upon Earth; Is not that a Point of Diſcipline? All that reſpects the Guidance and Government of the Church, the Perſons, their Characters, their Charges, their Dignities, their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Juriſdiction, are they not of the Diſcipline of the Church? If with this Pretext it ſhould be objected to the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> Gentlemen, your Hierarchy in the whole, and in all its parts, is a meer matter of Diſcipline; the Church might poſſibly err concerning it; and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to review and re-examine it: What
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:99003:27"/>would they reply to it? Methinks they would anſwer, that it is a Point of Diſcipline, which is alſo a Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of Right. At leaſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> hath ſo defined it; and hath treated of the Hierarchy under the head of matters of Doctrine. There are indeed three kinds of Doctrine: the firſt are purely Speculative; as the Myſtery of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: the ſecond are Practical, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting our Manners, and of this kind are the Moral Precepts that are the Rules for governing our Life, and directing our Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the third are thoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Doctrines that reſpect the Guidance and Government of the Church; that is to ſay, that there muſt be a Miniſtry in the Church; that Believers ought to obey their Guides; that the Reſidence of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops is by Divine Right; that the Paſtors are inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that there muſt be a Lawful Call to the Miniſtry, that ſo there may be a Right of governing the Church, that ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be Tyrannical; that the Church may not withdraw Believers from their Lawful Lords in Temporal matters. It is moſt clear, that all theſe are Points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine reſpecting Diſcipline. So that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that errs in Points of Diſcipline that have
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:99003:27"/>an inſeparable Connexion with thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals, does by neceſſary conſequence err in Doctrine. But to render this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſideration the more ſenſible, I will particularly apply it to ſome Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Articles of Diſcipline, wherein it is confeſſed that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath exceeded the limits of its Power; and which I will make out to be Articles of Doctrine alſo: ſo that ſuch as will confeſs that Council to have erred in Diſcipline, ſhall be conſtrained to acknowledge that it hath erred in Doctrine, and in matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">That the Popes Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over Councils is a Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and was decided in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note>Let us begin with the Article of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of the Council over the Pope, or of the Pope over the Council. Few are ignorant with what heat this Queſtion has conſtantly been argued ever ſince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil;</hi> both of which pronounced the Pope inferiour to a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; and the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church makes it an Article of her Faith to maintain the deciſions of thoſe Councils. But I would fain be informed whether it be an Article of Faith, or of Diſcipline: yet I think there is no doubt but it will be avowed for a Point of Doctrine, it having always been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch. It is alſo certainly a Point of Diſcipline: for all that reſpects the Form of the Churches Government may
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:99003:28"/>fitly be brought under the head of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. This important matter the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decided in favour of the Pope; and yet the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church ſtill perſeveres in the contrary belief: She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves therefore that the Council erred in a Point of Doctrine. I know it will be ſaid, That the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath not decided, that the Pope is Superiour to Councils. Men may talk as they pleaſe, but things for all that will continue as they are. It is true, that among the Decrees and Canons of that Council, there is none that ſays in expreſs terms, <hi>The Pope is Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Councils, and can be judged by none:</hi> but the effect of ſuch Deciſion is apparent in all the Acts, and through the whole Conduct of this Council. It is neceſſary for eſtabliſhing the Sovereignty of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, that the States of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try make a formal Declaration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acknowledge him their Maſter and their Sovereign? Is it not enough, that they obey him; that they ſuſpend their reſolutions, are convened, and diſſolved, at his pleaſure; that in their Acts they ſtile him their Lord, and their King; and that they own that all they do is nothing unleſs confirmed by his Authority? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are none ſo unreaſonable as to deny this to be of equal Value with any
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:99003:28"/>expreſs Declaration of Sovereignty. We ſhall therefore make it unqueſtionably clear, that the carriage of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> towards the Pope hath been in all points ſuch.</p>
            <p>In order to this, it is to be remembred, that the fifth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as a General Council, aſſembled by <hi>Julius</hi> II. begun in the year 1512, under <hi>Leo</hi> X.) had repealed, annulled and abrogated the <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanction;</hi> which was an Abſtract of the Deciſions of the Councils of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> made at <hi>Bourges</hi> in the year 1438. by Order of <hi>Charles</hi> VII. in a ſolemn Aſſembly of all the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Parliaments. The grand deſign of it was to abaſe the Pope, and to retrench the Tyrannical part of his Power: the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of all the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Proceedings of this Aſſembly, being founded upon the Principle of the Subjection of Popes to Councils. But then comes <hi>Julius</hi> II. in his Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and re-eſtabliſhes the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over the Council, declaring null and void all that had been done in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of it by the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> Twenty eight years after was the firſt Convocation of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Between theſe there had been no General
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:99003:29"/>Council, nor any thing in prejudice of that Superiority that was ſo re-eſtabliſhed by the Council of <hi>Lateran:</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there was ſomething actually done of great advantage to it; which was the <hi>Concordat. Lewis</hi> XII. who had the great Conteſts with Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> died in the beginning of the year 1315. <hi>Francis</hi> I. ſucceeded, who paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> took <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Genoua,</hi> and viſited the Pope, then <hi>Leo</hi> X. at <hi>Bologna.</hi> It was at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview that the <hi>Concordat</hi> was made, by which the King conſented to the aboliſhing of the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ſhould have the Right of Preſentation to all great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. Thus have we the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> and all the Deciſions of the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, with reſpect to <hi>France:</hi> and the Pope re-eſtabliſhed by this Act in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Superiority over all the Church, and over the Councils without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> did indeed appeal from this <hi>Concordat</hi> to the next Council: but that ſtill makes for the Pope; becauſe the Univerſity did not at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> proſecute the Appeal; by which ſilence the thing continued as the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> had adjudged it, and as the <hi>Concordat</hi> had confirmed it.
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:99003:29"/>Beſides, the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> held by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> at the ſame time the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil</hi> was held, did annul and make void all that was done at <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> in prejudice of the Popes Authority. <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> acknowledge this of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> for a Lawful and General Council. And then there are two General Councils that exalt the Pope over the Council. Then comes the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and does not the leaſt Act to invalidate or leſſen the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the two preceding Councils. On the contrary, it was convened upon this ground, that the Pope was abſolute Maſter of it, to continue or diſſolve it at his pleaſure. It always appears to be acted by this Principle, paying in all things Submiſſion to the Pope. Is it not then apparent that this Article is decided by the very Conduct of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo exactly agreeable to the Deciſions of the Councils of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Lateran?</hi> If there ariſe queſtion of Juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Judges, and there be a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the matter, and he that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Sentence to be the Inferiour do for the future act as ſuch without appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Judgment; does it not always paſs as an adjudged Caſe; and is not ſuch Superiour eſteemed in peaceable poſſeſſion of his Superiority? There is therefore no
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:99003:30"/>more to do but to conſider the Conduct of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſee if from the beginning to the end of it, it hath not always paid to the Pope the reſpect of an Inferiour to a Superiour.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Name given by the Council to the Pope. And methinks it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that Words ſhould be the juſt and faithful Images of Thoughts; and that the Names given to Perſons be underſtood to ſignifie the naked Characters under which they are to be conſidered. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> called the Pope their moſt Holy Lord, <hi>Sanctiſſimus Dominus noſter;</hi> as may be ſeen in divers places; two I ſhall cite. The firſt is that of the Controverſie of the Reſidence of Biſhops, whether by Divine Right or not. The greater part were for declaring it in the Affirmative: but the reſt ſaid either, <hi>Placet, priùs conſulto San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſimo Domino noſtro;</hi> or elſe, <hi>Non placet; niſi priùs conſulto Sanctiſſimo Domino noſtro.</hi> It is no ſort of anſwer to ſay that theſe men were far leſs in number than the others; for the difference of Votes reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queſtion only, whether he Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſhould be left to the Pope: but as to the Name given him, it was conteſted by none. It were in vain, and even ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to go about to deny this. For it is the Language of the very Decrees of the
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:99003:30"/>Council to the Pope. Read but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of referring to the Pope the demand of the Cup, at the end of the twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Seſſion: <hi>The Council hath ordained that this whole matter be referred to our moſt holy Lord, ad Sanctiſſimum Dominum noſtrum.</hi> It cannot be ſaid that this was only the Complement of a few Flatterers: It is a Decree of the Council maturely debated and approved by all the Fathers. As a Proteſtant I might well ſay, that it ſeems an odd kind of thing to qualifie the Pope with a Title that was never given by the Apoſtles to Chriſt himſelf: They call him barely or Lord; and never, our holy, or our moſt holy Lord. For my part I do not ſee that this ſtile of moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or thrice holy, is to be aſcribed to any but to God alone: <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> But this is not my preſent buſineſs. It is enough for me to prove by it, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath owned and acknowledged the Pope, not ſimply for Superiour, but for Sovereign, Maſter, Lord, and moſt holy Lord.</p>
            <p>Among the proofs we bring to ſhew that the Council hath acknowledged the Pope for its Superiour; we ought not to ſlight the Cuſtom, ſo inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that Aſſembly from firſt to laſt, to deliberate of nothing, nor make
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:99003:31"/>any Deciſion, but according to the Orders of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is in vain to ſay, that it ought not to be imputed to the Council; but to the Legats that preſided therein. The Council did it, the Council ſuffered it, and all things were turned on that Hinge. I know very well that the ſound and unbyaſſed Part of the Council were very much troubled at it: but I alſo know that the far greater part would have it ſo, not barely conſenting to, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting this Conduct of the Legats: For all the <hi>Italians</hi> were of intelligence with the Pope for the ſubjecting the Council to him. Theſe Aſſemblies are obliged to anſwer not only for what they do by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, but alſo for what they do by Surprize. All Hiſtorians agree that the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Intentions and Orthodox Minds. And yet becauſe they ſuffered themſelves to be ſurpriſed by the Artifice of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſacius,</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> it is reckoned among the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councils. It muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>Italian</hi> ſubtilty was never raiſed to a higher pitch, than by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to make it act as abſolutely depending on the Pope. And it muſt alſo be acknowledged, that as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſucceed in the Deſign, ſo it thereby engaged the Council
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:99003:31"/>in a Conduct that evidently eſtabliſhes an Opinion which paſſes for erroneous in the minds of many people. For what more can be done by the moſt inferiour Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies towards their Sovereigns, than to debate nothing but by their direction, and to determine nothing but by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</p>
            <p>That Clauſe that occaſioned ſo much noiſe, and ſo great diſcontent, that the Council could deliberate of nothing but what was propoſed by the Legats, <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus Legatis,</hi> is it not a plain Deciſion of the Popes Superiority over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? Was there ever any Inferiour that durſt preſcribe to his Superiours the Points upon which they were to deliberate; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, you ſhall ſpeak only as I direct you, you ſhall debate the Propoſitions that I ſhall make you, and you ſhall not dare to exceed the bounds I ſet you? Yet ſuch was one of the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſigned by all the Fathers, and made at the opening of the third and moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Convocation of the Council. Was there any thing done to remedy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this Clauſe? Truly juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in effect. There was a little Decree made (and little it ſignified) to pacifie diſſatisfied minds: it was, that the Legats a little before the end of the Council ſhould
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:99003:32"/>declare that it was not intended by this Clauſe to prejudice the liberty of the Council, nor at all to alter the manner of proceeding that former Councils had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: but it is not ſaid that there was no intent to prejudice the opinion that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Council to the Pope.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that ſhall read this Hiſtory, will find by what paſſed from the twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the twenty third Seſſion, what Endeavours were uſed by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſlide in a Decree among the Acts of the Council to eſtabliſh the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. There was a Minute of ſuch a Decree ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein it was ſaid, that the Pope hath power to govern the Univerſal Church, <hi>Eccleſiam univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> The Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to oppoſe it, as eaſily penetrating the Deſign of exalating the Pope over the whole Church; of making him abſolute Maſter of it; and by conſequence placing him above Councils. Well then, and what was the iſſue of the Diſpute? The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> feigned to yield the Point, and the Decree did not paſs: but yet the thing was after cunningly done in another Decree, where the very words are uſed, but in a way that ſeems as if it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign. It is in the firſt Chapter of General Reformation in the laſt Seſſion,
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:99003:32"/>where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Pope has the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> Theſe words do plainly ſignifie that the Pope is ſole Biſhop, that the others are but his Delegates, and by conſequence that he is the Monarch and Superiour of the Church, whether it be conſidered together as a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or disjunctly in its Parts. If the words might admit of another conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the very Council it ſelf did thus interpret them, and therefore for a time did reject them; tho afterwards it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them by inadvertence. And this is another expreſs Deciſion that exalts the Pope above the whole Church.</p>
            <p>It would certainly be tireſom to the Reader, ſhould I produce all the Proofs that might be brought, to ſhew that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath acknowledged the Pope for Superiour. For I ſhould then be obliged to ſpeak of the Bulls of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that were regiſtred and received by the Council, in which the ſole power of convening Councils, and preſiding in them is aſcribed to the Pope, contrary to the Deciſions of the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> I ſhould alſo ſpeak of the Bulls of Suſpenſion ſent by the Popes to their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, by which as Maſters and Superiours they impowered them to ſuſpend, and to diſſolve the Council. I ſhould in fine be
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:99003:33"/>obliged to ſpeak of all that was done in thoſe two important Controverſies that made ſo much noiſe in the Council: that is, whether the Epiſcopal Order were of Chriſts Inſtitution, and whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of Eccleſiaſticks be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> But I ſhall leave the Readers to make due Reflections upon the Legats preſiding in the Council, and their management of affairs. I ſhall only offer two Proofs, but the moſt convincing that can be. The firſt ſhall be the laſt Chapter of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the laſt Seſſion. In this Chapter the Council declares, <hi>That all that hath been ordained concerning the Reformation of Manners, and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline is ſo ordained as that the Council will thereby manifeſt to all the world, that the Authority of the holy Apoſtolick See remains whole and untouched:</hi> That is to ſay, that the Pope is not bound by the Canons, nor tied from diſpenſing with them when he thinks fit. This is not our Gloſs, but the Court of <hi>Rome's;</hi> it is the plain intent of the Council that framed the Decree: it is agreeable to conſtant and continual Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for the Pope <hi>de facto</hi> does daily diſpenſe with the Canons of this Council. It could not more plainly be pronounced that the Pope is Maſter and Sovereign of the Council: nor could any thing be more
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:99003:33"/>directly contrary to the Deciſions of the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> This latter Council, ſpeaks thus in the fourth and fifth Seſſion, <hi>The holy Synod of</hi> Conſtance <hi>duly aſſembled, being a General Council, and repreſenting the Catholick Church, is empowered imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditely from Jeſus Chriſt: which every perſon, of whatſoever condition or dignity, tho even of the Papal dignity, is bound to obey in all things that relate to Faith, the extirpation of Hereſie, and the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, as well in the Head as in the Members.</hi> That is to ſay, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance</hi> declares, that the Pope is bound to obey the Canons of the Council: And the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares, that the Authority of the Council reaches not to the Pope, but leaves his Power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, One of the two Councils has therefore certainly erred, for their Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are in direct contrariety to each other.</p>
            <p>The laſt Proof I ſhall urge, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of its Decrees, which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> deſired of the Pope. If that does not ſuppoſe that without ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation the Decrees of the Council were of no force, as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends, it ſignifies juſt nothing. If the Validity of the Deciſions of a General Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Popes Confirmation, it <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">
                  <desc>〈4 pages missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:99003:34"/>it into Propoſitions; and then it runs thus: The Church hath Power over the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties of Kings, and private Perſons; can take away their Poſſeſſions, and give them to others; can proceed to Sentence and Execution by Corporal puniſhment, by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and Sequeſtration; can take cogniſance of the validity of Wills and Teſtaments; can oblige Laymen to give an account of their management of Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for pious Uſes; hath Power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe all manner of Judicature, and in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Cauſes excluſive to all other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals; In a word, can hear and determine all matters Civil and Criminal. Is there not reaſon then to allow this for Doctrine? Is not Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction matter of Doctrine? Hath not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> treated of it in the Chapter of <hi>Order,</hi> as of a point of Doctrine? If the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the Church be a matter of Doctrine is it not abſurd to ſay that the Decrees to which ſuch Juriſdiction does extend are meerly points of Diſcipline? Are not the Whole, and its Parts, of one nature? I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Juriſdiction of the Church conſidered together and in groſs belongs to Doctrine why not the parts, the branches, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it likewiſe? Thus have we ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther point of Doctrine, in which the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church and all the Magiſtrates of
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:99003:34"/>the Chriſtian World do affirm the Council to have erred.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">That Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks is a point of Doctrine; wherein it is confeſſed that the Council erred.</note>I go on to the Exemptions of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, which are of near affinity to the preceding Article. The Biſhops of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the Decree we juſt ſpake of, by them intitled <hi>the Reformation of Princes,</hi> had made little Sovereigns of the Clergy independent of the Secular Power; exempted from pleading before a Temporal Judge, for whatſoever Cauſe or Crime. 'Tis true this Decree did not paſs, by reaſon of the great oppoſition made by the Ambaſſadors. But the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil endeavoured to ſupply the matter; for in the twentieth Chapter of General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in the 25th. Seſſion, it ordains, that the Immunities, Exemptions, and Privileges of Eccleſiaſticks be ratified and confirmed to them, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Popes, and Councils, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the holy Canons. Now theſe Conſtitutions and theſe Canons, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance whereof it commands, are thoſe that withdraw Eccleſiaſticks from the Power of Secular Judgment, and ſubject them only to the Judges of the Church. And indeed ſince the Council, the Clergy have with the utmoſt vigour endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the maintaining themſelves in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of theſe Privileges. Every body
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:99003:35"/>knows the famous Quarrel that upon this occaſion happened between Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and made ſo great a noiſe in the beginning of this preſent Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> in the year 1605. made a Law, forbidding Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks to acquire Lands and fixt Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: and before that, there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law in force, reſtraining the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches, Hoſpitals, and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries without leave obtained of the Senate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At the ſame time the Republick cauſed to be impriſoned <hi>Brandolino Valde-Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> Abbot of <hi>Nerveze;</hi> and <hi>Scipione Saraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> Canon of <hi>Vicenza:</hi> the firſt, as being guilty of Rapine and Theft, accuſed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe Eccleſiaſtical Immunities were things unknown to the Primitive times.

There is an inſtance of this in the troubles that hapned in <hi>France</hi> about the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> There were four Biſhops that after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Janſenius</hi> by <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. kept a wrangling and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing, a little too long in the Jeſuits opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon the diſtinction of Right and Fact, to avoid ſigning of the <hi>Formulary.</hi> The good Fathers procured a <hi>Brief</hi> from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to interdict them by Commiſſaries named by the Pope. Theſe four Biſhops, who were the Biſhops of <hi>Alez,</hi> of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and of <hi>Angers,</hi> defended themſelves againſt the Interdiction by Circular Letters, and by divers publick Writings, wherein they cite the Ancient Canons, the fifteenth of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the year 341. the ſeventh of the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> 351. the <hi>Capitula</hi> of <hi>Adrian</hi> I. the Deciſions of <hi>Leo</hi> IV. and of <hi>Benedict</hi> III. his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, who lived about the middle of the Ninth Century.

And ſtill they muſt give me leave to tell them, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is nothing but a meer illuſion. For it is a real Point of Doctrine, to know how
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:99003:37"/>far the Rights of Biſhops do or do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. It is a clear Caſe that all the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the Biſhops complain of depend upon the queſtion, Whether Biſhops were inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt, and are the Apoſtles Succeſſors. For if Biſhops are by Divine Right, and not of Papal Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it is manifeſt that the Pope cannot deprive them of a power he did not give them, nor can ſo much as leſſen that power. If a Biſhop does <hi>jure divino</hi> watch over the conduct of thoſe of his Dioceſs, there is no man that by any right can take a part of his Flock from him, or forbid him to execute his Paſtoral Charge in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for no man hath power to alter what God hath eſtabliſhed. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if the Pope hath conferred upon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops all the Authority they have, he may revoke, leſſen, or enlarge it at his plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure; nor could the Biſhops then have any cauſe to complain, for he may make uſe of his juſt right and power. If the Pope be abſolute Maſter of the Church, and Biſhops but his Subſtitutes, he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed judicially againſt them as he thinks moſt fit, by a Synod, by Commiſſaries, or by himſelf. And the Biſhops know it very well: for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, who ſtickled ſo much in the Council that the Reſidence and Inſtitution of Biſhops might
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:99003:38"/>be declared to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> had no other end in it, but to ſtrengthen the Epiſcopal Dignity, and ſhake off the Papal Yoke that oppreſſed them. The Authors of thoſe Writings that have made ſo much noiſe in the world about the affair of <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures</hi> are likewiſe perfectly convinced of this truth. For ſpeaking of the wrongs done to Biſhops by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they tell us, that the Popes Miniſters <hi>take delight to ſhew in Act and by Example what the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctors teach in their Books:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Circular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the four Biſhops, p. <hi>15.</hi>

               <hi>That the Pope is the abſolute Maſter and Sovereign of the Church: That Biſhops are but his Vicars, holding all their power from him: That he either does, or does not hearken to them, as he thinks fit: That if he makes anſwer when they conſult him, he does them grace and favour, but does them no wrong if he refuſe to anſwer.</hi> To this erroneous and falſe opinion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Partiſans of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they oppoſe the pure truth of the Goſpel; that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>That all Biſhops do ſucceed to the Apoſtles: That the Pope by Divine Right is their Head and Superiour, but not the ſole Biſhop: That they derive their power from Chriſt himſelf: That it is the Holy Ghoſt that hath ſet them over the Flock, that the Great Shepherd hath acquired by his bloud, that each might govern as his
<pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:99003:38"/>Vicar that portion that falls to his lot,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they are ſo inferiour to the Pope, as to be yet his Brethren, and Collegues in that only Epiſcopat, of which each of them holds an intire part according to the Fathers.</hi> This is truly the ſtate of the Queſtion; and can this be thought to be a mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Diſcipline? Or can it be other than a Point of Doctrine? When the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> did ſo mightily inſiſt in the Council, to have it declared that Biſhops are not the Popes Vicars, nor ſet up by him, but eſtabliſhed by Chriſt; and when on the other ſide the Partiſans of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſed this deſign with ſo much violence, every where preaching up the Pope to be the ſole Biſhop; that the Ordinaries are but a ſucceſſion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, holding all their Authority from the Holy See, was this Controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the two Parties as a matter of Diſcipline? Was it not conſidered in the Examen of the Sacrament of Orders, which is a Point of Doctrine? And not touched in the Chapters of Reformation, to which was referred all that concerned Diſcipline. The Biſhops could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to have it declared that their Order is by Divine Right; but at leaſt they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that no Decree was made for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them only the Popes Vicars. Yet
<pb n="lxxxii" facs="tcp:99003:39"/>that is of no great ſervice to them; for in all the Decrees of the Council they are ſtill treated as the Popes Vicars. And it muſt needs be acknowledged that the Council, in declaring that the Pope hath power to abridge the Authority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to hinder their Epiſcopal Functions, to try them in Perſon, or by his Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hath ſufficiently declared them to be no more than his Vicars. So we have another Point of Doctrine wherein two thirds of <hi>Europe</hi> agree that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> hath erred.</p>

<pb n="lxxxvi" facs="tcp:99003:41"/>People, or at leaſt by their conſent. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> who lived about the middle of the twelfth Century, does in his Decretal bring divers proofs of this matter. For inſtance, in the Canon <hi>quanto,</hi> there is an Extract out of the ſecond Book of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, drawn from Epiſt. 30.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 63.</note> Chap. 69. wherein the Pope, after the death of <hi>Laurence,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> orders to Elect him a Succeſſor, not by the Votes of the Clergy only, but of all the People. And becauſe many of the People of <hi>Milan</hi> were at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to avoid the Calamities of War, <hi>Gregory</hi> requires that perſons be ſent to <hi>Genoa</hi> to take the Votes of the abſent. In the Canon <hi>Plebs Diotrenſis,</hi> he relates an Ordinance of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> who lived in the year 492. by which that Pope declares, that a Biſhop is to be choſen by the ſuffrage of all the People. <hi>Leo</hi> I. was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> thirty or forty years before this <hi>Gelaſius:</hi> In the 87. of his Epiſtles, he ſays it is neceſſary to render an Election Canonical, that the chief of the Laity do give their Votes, as <hi>Gratian</hi> reports it in the ſame Diſtinction, in the Canon <hi>Vota civium.</hi> Again, in the Canon <hi>Sacrorum</hi> we have an Ordinance drawn from the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula</hi> of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and of <hi>Louis le De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnaire</hi> his Son, which declares that
<pb n="lxxxvii" facs="tcp:99003:41"/>Biſhops are to be elected and eſtabliſhed by the Votes of the People, and of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and not otherwiſe. One might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend yet lower, to the Canonical Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by the Votes of the People nearer to our times. But it is not needful, and poſſibly what we have already ſpoken of this matter is ſuperfluous, this Article not being conteſted. It remains then only to remark, that this ſo conſtant practice of the pure and primitive Church, is condemned as Heretical by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> It will without queſtion be replied, that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Council concerns only the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Prieſts, and not the Election of Biſhops: that the Council only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Opinion, that Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends of the People; and does not condemn the Canonical Election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, made by the Votes of the People. But the Canon immediately following ſhews the vanity of this reply, wherein the Council declares, that ſuch Biſhops as have been promoted by the only authority of the Pope, without any Aſſembly of Biſhops, conſent of Clergy, or ſuffrage of the People, are true and lawful Biſhops; and <hi>Anathema</hi> is pronounced againſt all that believe otherwiſe. Is not that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Sentiments of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who ſay that a Biſhop who is not
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:99003:42"/>elected by his Clergy, choſen by his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and conſecrated in an Aſſembly of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, is not a true Biſhop? When the Council ſays, that a Biſhop who is neither elected by his Clergy, choſen by his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor Conſecrated by other Biſhops, is yet a lawful Biſhop, if ſent by the Pope. If this be not to anathematiſe Canonical Elections, there is no ſuch thing as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe; or elſe it is come in faſhion for things to be expreſſed by terms of juſt oppoſite ſignification. How can it be, that it is not intended to exclude the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the right of giving their Suffrages in the Election of Biſhops, by the Canon which ſays that Conſent and Vocation are not neceſſary to the validity of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For if the People have no voice in the Election of a Prieſt, how is it that they may vote in the Election of Biſhops, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Prieſts? If it be further replied, that the Election and the Ordination both of Prieſt and Biſhop are to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; that the People may have voice in the Election, but can have none in the Ordination. I anſwer, that Ordination is but a conſequent of Election; and when the People vote in the Election of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, they do it to the Ordination. But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church the People have no voice, neither for Election, nor Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:99003:42"/>This therefore ought to be a fixed and determined Point among all that wiſh for the re-eſtabliſhing of Canonical Elections, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath erred in deſtroying them. It only remains to ſee whether it be an Error ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in Diſcipline, or in Doctrine. But this can admit of no difficulty: the two Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which ruine Canonical Elections, are in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Doctrine of the Sacrament of Orders; and not in that of Reformation, which relates to Diſcipline. And indeed it is clearly a Point of Doctrine that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely depends upon that great Principle maintained againſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Followers of <hi>Gerſon;</hi> that is, that the Keys were given, not to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but to the whole Church: <hi>This,</hi> ſays the Author of the Apology for <hi>Gerſon, is the principal Point of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Prafations.</note> 
               <hi>that this moſt Orthodox Doctor lays down, as does St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>for a moſt ſtrong and firm ſupport of the Sentiments of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Paris, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and by himſelf gave the Keys to the whole Church in General, and conſidered as a Body, to the intent that the power of them might be exerciſed by one. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently St</hi> Peter, <hi>and the other Prelates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered apart, are in poſſeſſion of the Keys
<pb n="xc" facs="tcp:99003:43"/>but miniſterially and inſtrumentally, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the whole Church, to which the Keys do appertain principally, and in reſpect of dominion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Tract. 124. in <hi>Joh.</hi> and Tract. 50.</note> It is certain that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s opinion is, that Chriſt gave the Keys to the whole Church in general, as compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the People and of the Clergy. Now it that be ſo, moſt certainly the Votes both of the People and of the Clergy are neceſſary to a lawful Ordination. For if the Keys belong to Chriſtians in general, they are not to be intruſted but by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath erred even by the confeſſion of a great part of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it hath erred in points of Doctrine. I will only add a word or two about Clandeſtine Marriages. The Council in Seſſion 24. hath declared them to be null. This is a point of Doctrine; for it is a queſtion that directly touches the matter of Sacraments; that is to ſay, Whether the Church can invalidate an action which was till then a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Council declares that Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriages are true Sacraments, and at the ſame time declares them to be null and void. It muſt therefore have a Power of annulling true Sacraments. And this is a queſtion of Right, and a point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="xci" facs="tcp:99003:43"/>if ever there were any. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs upon this point, which is a matter of Doctrine, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not conceive her ſelf bound to believe that the Council hath not erred.</p>

               </note>The Divines of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> tell us, <hi>that the Decree of the Invalidity of Clandeſtine Marriages, which belongs to the matter of the Sacrament, according to the univerſal Opinion, is not obligatory in places where the Council hath not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated: So that it is agreed on all hands, that in ſuch places Clandeſtine Marriages are good.</hi> To conclude, it were unjuſt to oblige us to have a better Opinion of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> than the very Fathers of that Council had. But to conſider the manner of their words and actions, it is a very hard matter to think that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were convinced that that Aſſembly was infallible. There can be nothing more true and more judicious than what was ſaid by <hi>Baptiſta Cigale</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Albenga,</hi> when the Canons upon the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were to be formed; <hi>That no Man ever quitted his Opinion meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe condemned; and that when Doctors remit matters to the Judgment of the Church, it is no more than a civility and ſhould not be abuſed.</hi> This Man ſpake as he thought; and I am miſtaken if one
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:99003:44"/>that talks thus be well ſatisfied that Councils are infallible. If an inſtance be required of the truth of this expreſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Albenga,</hi> it is found in this very Council, in the conduct of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> and of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the queſtion, Whether our Lord did Sacrifice himſelf in the Inſtitution of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt? It is certainly an important queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the famous Controverſie of the Sacrifice of the Maſs depending abſolutely upon it. The Arch-Biſhop and his Partizans after the deciſion of the matter, perſevered in their Opinion, and even in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until the very moment the Decree was publiſhed. They were not, in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, convinced that the Council was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; but on the contrary, they ſeemed ſtrongly perſuaded that it had erred in a point of Doctrine of great importance.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Principal reaſons brought by the Proteſtants to evince that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with juſtice be obliged to ſubmit to the Deciſions of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> They have alſo other Reaſons that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them that they are obliged not to ſubmit to it: as that they believe that this Council hath eſtabliſhed Errors that deſtroy the true Religion. But it is not our intent to report or examine them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xciii" facs="tcp:99003:44"/>It is manifeſt that the underſtanding of the Reaſons we have produced, does whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon knowing the Hiſtory of this Council. And conſequently it is highly neceſſary for all ſuch Proteſtants to be well inſtructed in this Hiſtory as are deſirous to be able to defend the refuſal they make as Proteſtants to ſubmit to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The difficulty may be, to find a faithful Hiſtorian who may be credited in the matter. For it is certain that every one is not to be believed in it. We are told, that the Collections that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> may have made upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Council, can deſerve but little Faith; that they were Parties; that Objects are ſtrangely transformed by Paſſion; and that a relation by the Pen of an Author partial and by aſſed carries with it the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his Paſſions. But it hath pleaſed God in his Providence to raiſe up even in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Wiſe, a Moderate, a Judicious and ſincere Man, one that in a word was the greateſt Man of his Age, who hath carefully wrote this Hiſtory. He has all the Perfections required to compleat an Hiſtorian. Of great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Abilities, ſtrong and clear Senſe, perfectly inſtructed in Affairs, of a vaſt penetration, and one that wanted no kind of aſſiſtance needful to the compleating
<pb n="xciv" facs="tcp:99003:45"/>his Work. When this Author began to appear in the World, the memory of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was ſtill freſh in Mens Minds; ſo that he may very well paſs for a contemporary Author. He was a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to the place where the things he writes of had been tranſacted. He lived in a City full of Curious Perſons, who had collected Memorials of what had paſſed in this great Affair: and was himſelf one that kept correſpondence with all the Learned Men of <hi>Europe.</hi> Nay, he had great intimacy with <hi>Oliva Camillo,</hi> who had been Secretary to the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> Legat and Preſident of the Council in the laſt Convocation; and there is no doubt but he drew conſiderable advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to his Work from ſuch a Perſon, who had been an Eye-witneſs of all that had paſſed. Now ſince this Author was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lutheran</hi> nor Proteſtant, he is not in reaſon to be ſuſpected of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and as he was no ſervile Idolater of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, he ought not to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of the Proteſtants. There ſhines indeed throughout his whole Work an Air of ſincerity and honeſty, which happily united to his vaſt Abilities has made him paſs as unqueſtionably the ableſt of his Age in the Art of writing Hiſtory. But in an Age ſo depraved as ours, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:99003:45"/>to be honeſt. The Sincerity of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> hath raiſed againſt him a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Enemies. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> endeavours to make him paſs for a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, an Impoſtor, and the moſt Profligate of Men; and his Work for a malevolent and poiſonous Satyr. And yet to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny important Truths by him laid open to the World, nothing but Scurrilities are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; till at laſt after forty years Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> it ſeems bethought himſelf to publiſh a new Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or if you pleaſe an Anſwer to Father <hi>Paul,</hi> for he cites him and refutes him in every Page. This Work appeared with all the External Advantages that can well recommend a Book. It had Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. to whom it was dedicated, for Patron; and for Author, one of the, ſo called, Princes of the Church. One that was of a Society well acquainted with the Arts of engaging Mens Minds; and one that in this Work defended a Darling Cauſe favoured and ſupported by the Number and Quality of its Partiſans. And yet with all this, he has not been able to attract all that applauſe and approbation that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had hoped. Men judged that he came much too late to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Tranſactions of this Council. Nor indeed is an Opinion once ſetled ſo eaſily ſhaken off.

               <pb n="c" facs="tcp:99003:46"/>not be forgotten, he takes care to have it repeated in an Epiſtle Dedicatory, that he cauſes his Bookſeller to make to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume. Yet all that knew him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him to have been one of the moſt Wiſe and Pious Men, of great Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Paſſions, and very Religious. The Proof the Cardinal brings of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation is this, that Father <hi>Paul</hi> having all the Heretical Opinions, did yet live in the Communion of the Catholick Church; which ſhewed a ſetled Contempt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This ſure is a raſh way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is true, that by the Principles of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> Father <hi>Paul</hi> was a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick; for he did not believe that the Pope was abſolute Lord of the Church, that he had Power to Excommunicate Princes, and interdict their Dominions at his pleaſure: He did not believe there was any Obligation for a blind Obedience to the Pope's Commands: He did believe it very poſſible for the Pope to err, and that there is no ſubmiſſion due to his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: And he highly diſapproved that corruption in Diſcipline and Manners every where prevalent, but chiefly in the Papal Court. I muſt confeſs that according to the Principles of Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> and thoſe of his Party, this is enough to make him paſs at <hi>Rome</hi> for Impious and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt. And yet Father <hi>Paul</hi> in all his
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:99003:46"/>conteſts with the Pope for the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> hath always ſpoken of, what they call, <hi>the Holy See,</hi> with the greateſt reſpect imaginable. He lived and died in his Religion with the greateſt Devotion in the World. He was moſt exact in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all the Ceremonies of his Church. And though he was of a nice and tender Conſtitution, yet would he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſpence with himſelf in the keeping of <hi>Lent,</hi> even to ſeventy years of Age. In a word, he was an Atheiſt after the ſame manner that an infinite number of Perſons of Vertue and Honour in <hi>France, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> are ſo, who will not be Slaves to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who wiſh that ſeveral things were reformed in the Church; and yet diſapprove the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>It had been a ſurprizing thing, for a Jeſuit to write the Hiſtory of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> without frequent Blows at Father <hi>Paul,</hi> It is not therefore to be wondered at, if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maimbourg</hi> treats him ſometimes a little roughly. Though it muſt yet be ſaid, that he does it with leſs rudeneſs than the Cardinal. As I do not judg it needful to enter into the Particulars of the Accuſations of Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> for the juſtification of Father <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe it would draw me too far; ſo for the ſame reaſon I ſhall not amuſe my ſelf to juſtifie him in
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:99003:47"/>certain matters wherein Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi> accuſes him; though it were very eaſie to ſhew that Father <hi>Paul</hi> is more in the right than Father <hi>Maimbourg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet I cannot but here take ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what a ſufficient known Author ſays in a little Book, containing Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Hiſtory, and upon the Art of writing Hiſtory. This Author judges of the Quality and Merit of Hiſtorians me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks after a very Magiſterial manner. Among others he ſpeaks of Father <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſays;<note place="margin">Pag. 125.</note> 
               <hi>Never was anything written with greater wit, or with leſs reaſon and truth. He is facetious upon all occaſions, that he may not be thought angry; and is much too airy in a ſubject ſo ſerious.</hi> If this Author had conſulted <hi>Thuanus,</hi> to whom the <hi>French</hi> owe ſome reſpect, his Hiſtory being an honour to their Country, he would not have given ſuch a Character of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> for he would have ſeen that theſe two great men do perfectly agree. For my part, by our modern Authors good leave, I ſhall much rather give credit to M. <hi>de Salo,</hi> a famous Counſellour in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> Author of the firſt Journals under the name of the Sieur <hi>de Hedouville:</hi> And thus he ſpeaks in the Journal of 23 of <hi>March,</hi> 1665. <hi>As Cardinal</hi> Pallavicini <hi>has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, one cannot read nor underſtand his
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:99003:47"/>Book, without alſo reading Father</hi> Paul's. <hi>And then there is ſome danger, that Hiſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well done, that one may prefer it before the Cardinals, which may be truer, but is not more probable.</hi> It is eaſie to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand the meaning of theſe words from ſo prudent a perſon as M. <hi>de Hedou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> I am tempted to believe that the Author of the Reflections upon the Art of writing Hiſtory has never read the Hiſtory of Father <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he ſays that that Hiſtorian makes mirth with every thing, and is much too airy in ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a ſubject. Whereas never was any Work of a more different Character, more wiſe, more moderate, more free from fooliſh triſling mirth. So that, becauſe in the body of ſo large a Work there are found ſome few Railleries of Perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the Council, reported with the fidelity of an exact Hiſtorian, to call this a continual drolling, is willingly to expoſe his Reputation and his Judgment. But if in this particular I was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, I could hardly believe my eyes in reading another Period ſome few Pages following in the ſame Book; <hi>That this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is a Satyr upon the</hi> Roman <hi>Church and Religion,</hi>

            <p>True it is, that Father <hi>Paul</hi> lays open the very bottom of the conduct of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, and plainly ſhews it to be governed meerly by humane Policy. Yet are his Enemies very imprudent to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that to him as a Crime; becauſe that Imputation conſtrains his Defenders to make it apparent that the Hiſtory of Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> is a thouſand times more injurious to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than is that written by Father <hi>Paul.</hi> This latter indeed is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to have expreſſed diſcontent and ſpite againſt that Court, for diſcovering the Maxims of its Policy; and ſhewing its aim to be onely Power and Greatneſs; and that it had no regard to the Intereſts of Piety and Religion. But it is moſt certain that Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> does expoſe it under that Character extreamly more than Father <hi>Paul.</hi> The Father contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with remarking its Conduct, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us the Hiſtory of its Actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying much of its Maxims. But the Cardinal gives us the naked View of all the Maxims of the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity, ſhews us the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of it, and that it conſiſts of
<pb n="cix" facs="tcp:99003:48"/>humane and carnal things, blended with things dangerous and criminal. It is true, that in propoſing the Maxims of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he undertakes alſo to defend it; and makes a mighty merit of it in thoſe that are the Guides and Directors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: whileſt thoſe that are of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sentiments paſs with him for ſottiſh, ignorant and blind Zealots. But in praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Criminal Maxims, he does not make them better. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father <hi>Paul</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicini</hi> is this, Father <hi>Paul</hi> in giving us the Hiſtory of the Polity of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> has done it in ſuch a manner as plainly ſhews his diſlike of it; and <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicini</hi> repreſents it too as it is, but wounds it deeper by his Apology, than its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do by their moſt ſevere Invectives. For had he gone about to ſhew us, that the Maxims of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Principles of its Morals, are directly oppoſite to the Spirit of Chriſt and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, he could have gone no better way to work.

The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was compoſed of men of Worth and Parts, that underſtood the World. When <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> II. took <hi>Trent</hi> in his way to <hi>Spain,</hi> the Legates made him a Magnificent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. They cauſes a Palace to be erected upon the River of <hi>Adige,</hi> three hundred paces from the City, and treated him there with a noble Entertainment, with a Comedy, Dancing, and all ſorts of
<pb n="cxvii" facs="tcp:99003:52"/>Divertiſements; that Prince himſelf dancing there. Father <hi>Paul</hi> had forgotten this Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſage; tho ſo ſingular and remarkable. The Ancient Councils, conſiſting of men un-refined, gave no Entertainments with Balls and Comedies. This is the Picture <hi>Pallavicini</hi> gives us of the Conduct and Maxims of the Council, and of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And has he not given it an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Deſcription? Has Father <hi>Paul</hi> done any thing like it? Has he ever ſaid any thing more injurious to it? Or is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the greateſt Enemies of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to give a more hideous Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Morals by which they govern themſelves at <hi>Rome?</hi> Let it be no more ſaid, that Father <hi>Paul,</hi> under the name of a Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> hath made a Satyr againſt the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> For a hundred ſuch Enemies as Father <hi>Paul</hi> can never prove ſo injurious to it, as the Illuſtrious Hiſtorian has who undertook its defence.</p>
            <p>But let it ſuffice to have ſpoken thus much of Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Work, a word or two now of our own. In reading Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory one may remark two things: The firſt, that it is filled with things abſolutely neceſſary to be known of all men, but more particularly of the Proteſtants. The ſecond thing is, that it is full of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Diſputes and Reflections: which
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:99003:53"/>makes it indeed moſt uſeful for Divines; but leſs fit for others. There is ſcarce any, but a Profeſs'd Divine, who could have the patience to read a Folio Volume of ſeven or eight hundred Pages, of which two Thirds are moſt ſubtil and intricate School Diſputes. Which having already been tedious to the Biſhops who were of the Audience, it is not to be thought ſtrange that they are now tireſom to the Readers. So that altho this Work be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in its kind, yet it muſt needs be owned that it is uſeful but to a few.</p>
            <p>The Original is in a Language that not many in this Country underſtand. The Tranſlation that we have of it, is not new enough to ſatisfie ſuch as can ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Language that has an air of Antiquity. Both the Tranſlation and the Original are full of Graces that can never decay. And yet it is not to be denied but this Work hath loſt ſome of its Beauties by changing Language. For theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it falls out that this excellent Book is not ſo much read as it ought to be. It has been therefore conceived that the rendring this Work more Popular would be of great uſe to the World. And that is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the preſent Undertaking, there being nothing of importance forgotten here, yet Brevity is obſerved. And as for the Theological Diſputes, you have here
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:99003:53"/>all that is Eſſential in them for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature and State of the Controverſies that were managed in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> You have the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Arguments made uſe of by the ſeveral Parties for maintaining their Opinions. But the tedious Diſcourſes of the Divines and Prelates, which Father <hi>Paul</hi> reports at length, and with great exactneſs, are here omitted. This Hiſtory will at leaſt ſerve for theſe two ends: the one, to occaſion that abundance of People will inform themſelves in the Conduct of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who had never done it, if they had no other means but that of Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminious Work. The other, to refreſh the memory of thoſe that have read that Work, and let them review in little what there they ſaw more at large.</p>
            <p>In ſome places there is a diverſity as to Order between this Hiſtory and that of Father <hi>Paul;</hi> his being written in form of a Journal; which is the moſt proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for exactneſs, but is not always ſo pleaſing to the Reader. Great Affairs very rarely happen without interruption, ſeveral things intervene, and one and the ſame day may produce divers great Events. So that in obſerving the Order of Days, one is obliged to take the Reader from a ſubject of which he would fain ſee the Iſſue, and that makes him uneaſie. In
<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:99003:54"/>this Hiſtory therefore the Connexion of things is obſerved; which in that of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> are divided. And tho I have here obſerved the Order and Number of Books, yet there are many things in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory at the end of the Books, which are at the beginning here. Nay, there are ſome in a quite different Book; as the circumſtances of the great Quarrel between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence. They are diſperſed in the three laſt Books of Father <hi>Paul;</hi> but are here brought all together in the beginning of the eighth Book. This hint was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe ſuch as may have the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to read any Tranſaction at length, or to compare the two Hiſtories, not finding their matter juſt where they looked for it, might queſtion the fidelity of the Preſent Hiſtorian. But I begin to perceive that the length of this Diſcourſe, is a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Deſign of this Work. For it being compoſed in favour of thoſe who have little leiſure or inclination for long Reading; it is to be feared they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, we have been ſomewhat too tedious in the Introduction.</p>

Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> a man conſummated in School Divinity, was, at the bottom, of the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Adrian;</hi> but he told him however that that Doctrine was not to be divulged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would extinguiſh the Zeal that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had for Indulgences, and leſſen the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pope; for, ſaid he, if once the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be perſwaded that the Efficacy of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences depends upon their own good works, they will look upon themſelves as the cauſe of the benefit they reap from them, and ſet light by the Pope, and the preſent that he makes them: and farther they will eaſily be induced to believe that their good works alone, are ſufficient to procure them a full remiſſion, if they be allowed to think that the Efficacy of Indulgences depends upon their good works.

                     <hi>Adrian,</hi> in the mean while did not wholly lay aſide the deſign of reformation: he ſent for <hi>John Peter Caraffa</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Chieti,</hi> and <hi>Marcel Cazel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cajeta,</hi> that he might have the aſſiſtance of their Councils, becauſe both were held in great reputation for probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and knowledge in the Diſcipline of the Church. He was minded to have aboliſhed the uſe of Diſpenſations, and to have cut off every thing that looked like Simony; but when he came to caſt about for the means of effecting this, he found himſelf in great Perplexity. At length, <hi>Francis Soderin</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Volterre,</hi> put a ſtop to all theſe ſpecious deſigns of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: He told the Pope that that was the way to puff up the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party, that it would be a great blow to the Authority of the Church, by a reformation to confeſs her poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of erring; that Hereticks would from thence draw great advantages, and that the holy See would by that means loſe all its cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the minds of the People; he concluded

In a word, they ſolicited the Pope ſpeedily to call a free Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> where all, as well Seculars as Church-men might have free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſpeak their opinions. This diſcourſe did not at all pleaſe the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and therefore he addreſſed himſelf in a manner not very ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Diet; for his anſwer tended onely to let them know, that <hi>Germany</hi> ought to ſuffer with patience, and expect the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the holy See: and withall told them that he took it ill, that in demanding a Council, the Diet had added theſe words, <hi>with the Conſent of his Imperial Majeſty.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes who felt the oppreſſion ſtopt not there; they met by themſelves, and formed that famous writing, which they called <hi>centum gravamina,</hi> the hundred Grievances; the <hi>Nuncio</hi> had notice of it, but he departed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was drawn up fair; and therefore they themſelves ſent it to the Pope.

                  <p>The year 1526 was ſpent in theſe ſtirs; but next year after the War broke out with much greater flame and heat; there was now no more talk of Treaties, nor of a Council, all was buried in ſilence by the rage of Arms. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99003:64"/>Emperour had an Army in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> a Prince of the Bloud-royal and Conſtable of <hi>France;</hi> who falling into diſgrace, had betaken himſelf to the Emperour's ſervice, from whom he had received the Inveſtiture of the Dutchy of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and whereof he had made himſelf Maſter, in ſpight of the Efforts of the Confederates. This ſame <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> on the other ſide brought his Forces into the Field againſt the Pope, pretending to call him to an account as a Truce-breaker, becauſe of his procedure againſt the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s.

So on he marched, untill he came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped under the very Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> with a brave Army, but no Cannon. Next day after his arrival he made an aſſault by <hi>Scalade</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Vatican;</hi> and was there killed by a Muſquet Shot which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the right Groin. The Imperial Army, notwithſtanding, remained victorious, though vigorouſly oppoſed by the Pope's Soldiers, and <hi>Roman</hi> youth. The Town was taken by force, the Churches plundered, the Cardinals baſely uſed, led about in proceſſion riding on Aſſes in their Pontifical Habit, nay and ſome of them ſoundly baſtonnado'd too. Nothing was ſpared in the City; the plundering laſted three days, and all exceſs committed that the Rage of War could ſuggeſt.

The Pope rejected the Counſel that had been given him of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing and leaving the City; but for ſafety betook himſelf to the Caſtle St. <hi>Angelo;</hi> where being beſieged, he was forced to render on diſcretion, and was detained Priſoner in the ſame place. The City of <hi>Florence,</hi> that groaned under the Government of the <hi>Medicis,</hi> laid
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99003:65"/>hold on this occaſion of regaining their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for Cardinal <hi>Cortona</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the Pope, having left the place, the Citizens immediately, re-eſtabliſhed their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government, drove out the <hi>Medicis,</hi> and threw down their Statues. Whilſt this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy was acting, the Emperour was at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid;</hi> and being a great Maſter in the Art of Diſſimulation, ſeemed to be extremely affected with the ſad Condition of the Church, and of its Head the Pope: At <hi>Valladolid,</hi> where he was when the News was brought him, he cauſed the publick rejoycings, that then were making there for the Birth of his Son, to ceaſe: but made no haſte, for all that, to ſet the Pope at liberty; onely ſent him great Complements of Condoleance for his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ample Excuſes for what had been acted againſt him, and, in the mean time, let him lie ſeven Months in Priſon. Nor would he at all have been diſſatisfied it the Pope had been brought into <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might have triumphed over him, as he had done before over <hi>Francis</hi> I. But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that deſign, he durſt not puſh it farther; onely he obliged the Pope to accept of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Conditions of Peace, and for Caution, to give him up the Towns of <hi>Oſtia, Civita Vecchia, Civita Caſtellana,</hi> and the <hi>Citadel</hi> of <hi>Forli,</hi> with his tow Nephews <hi>Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for Hoſtages. This being concluded, he had liberty to goe out on the 9th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> but he thought it not fit to expect the prefixed day, nor to come out as a releaſed Priſoner; he therefore retired by Night on the Eighth, under the diſguiſe of a Merchant, and went to <hi>Monte-Fiaſcone.</hi>

Theſe Reaſons, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome private intereſts, obliged the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to break up the Conference: He recalled <hi>Granvelle,</hi> and adjourned the Diet to <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi> The opening of this Diet was in the month of <hi>March,</hi> next year after. The Emperour was there in perſon, and for a famous Diſpute that happened, named the Diſputants himſelf: for the Catholicks <hi>John Eckius, Julius Fluggius,</hi> and <hi>John Groper;</hi> for the Proteſtants, <hi>Melancthon, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>John Piſtorius:</hi> the Electour for the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99003:75"/>Proteſtants, and <hi>Granvelle</hi> for the Emperour, were Moderatours of the Conference. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Contarini,</hi> who had the reputation of a learned and wiſe man, was there as the Pope's Legate. Upon ſome points they came to an agreement, as upon Juſtification, the merit of Works, Free-will, Original Sin, the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in many others nothing could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon; as the Power of the Church, the Sacrament of Penance, Single Life, the Euchariſt, and the Hierarchy; not to name many conſiderable points that were not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with. The reſult of the Conference was communicated to the Diet; which the Legate pleaded ought to be ſent to the Pope for his judgment and approbation, and promiſed a General Council to prevent the holding of a National Synod. This Legate did ſet about the making of ſome Reformation in the Clergy; but that eſſay was fruitleſs, as all the former had been. At length the Emperour made the Edict of the Diet, date <hi>July</hi> the 28th, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he referred the deciſion of the Affair either to a General or National Council of <hi>Germany,</hi> or elſe to another Diet of the Empire.

But, in the mean time, by particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Grants, he allowed all a free exerciſe of Religion; ſo true it is, that the moſt zealous Princes in appearance, have no other Religion but Intereſt. However, they were pretty well ſatisfied at <hi>Rome,</hi> that theſe Conferences had

The Pope had heretofore called one at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> but he was forced to ſuſpend the Convocation, firſt till <hi>Eaſter</hi> in the year 1539. and afterwards by a Bull of the 13th of <hi>June</hi> the ſame year, the ſuſpenſion was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed untill it ſhould pleaſe the Pope to take it off. In the Conference of <hi>Luca,</hi> the Pope and the Emperour remained ſtedfaſt in their reſolution of holding the Council at <hi>Vicenza;</hi> but the <hi>Venetians</hi> to whom this City belonged, recalled the conſent they had given. They were afraid of offending the <hi>Turk,</hi> with whom they had juſt concluded a Peace, becauſe in that Council Overtures were to be propoſed of making War againſt the Infidels. This is the reaſon that was alledged; but the true reaſon, perhaps, was, that they were not very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the City ſhould be in a manner abandoned to ſo many Strangers, as muſt needs flock thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon account of the Council.</p>

                  <p>The Emperour having no aſſurances of the Pope, addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and made a League with him againſt <hi>France.</hi> That incenſed the Pope extremely, who complained publickly, that a Prince who ought to be Protectour of the Church, ſhould make alliance with an Excommunicate King. He added moreover, that ſince the beginning of the Troubles <hi>Charles</hi> had carried it with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme tenderneſs towards the Proteſtants; and to render that conduct of the Emperour the more odious, he compared it with that of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who had made ſo many ſevere Edicts and rigorous Laws againſt the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, for maintaining the Religion and Papal authority. This War, and theſe mutual miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings put a ſtop to all thoughts of a Council for that year 1543.

                  <p>THE War between the Emperour and King of <hi>France,</hi> had hitherto hindered the opening of the Council; but that War which laſted not much above a Year,<note place="margin">The Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and K. of <hi>France,</hi> revives the propoſals of a Council.</note> being ended by the Peace that was concluded at <hi>Creſpy, December</hi> 24. 1544. both Princes obliged themſelves to uſe their beſt endeavours for the preſervation of the ancient Religion and Union of the Church, and for the Reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that they might the better ſucceed in theſe three great Deſigns, they concluded it neceſſary to preſs the convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Council. The Pope willing to have all the Honour of it alone, ſo ſoon as he underſtood the Intentions of the Emperour and King of <hi>France,</hi> without expecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that theſe Princes deſigned to make to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99003:78"/>him, iſſued forth immediately, the Bull of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation for a Council to be held in the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> and appointed the 15. of <hi>March</hi> to be the firſt day of its Meeting. The Emperour was not pleaſed that this Publication was made without asking his Advice; however, he put the beſt Face he could upon it, as purpoſing to appear the principal Actor in this whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and ſent to all the Courts in <hi>Europe</hi> to invite the Princes to ſend their Prelates to <hi>Trent.</hi> He Aſſembled the Divines of <hi>Louvain,</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to reduce the Matters in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie into certain Heads, to be preſented to the Council. They thereupon made two and thirty bare Concluſions without any Reaſons or Arguments to back them; and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who loved to be Supreme as well in Matters of Religion as in the Affairs of State, afterwards confirmed them by an Edict. The King of <hi>France</hi> would needs doe the ſame, and Aſſembled the Divines of <hi>Paris</hi> at <hi>Melun,</hi> to conſult about the Matters that were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Council; but they could not agree; for, ſome were for demanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Pragmatick Sanction, and the Decrees of the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> Others were againſt it, becauſe that would be to declare themſelves againſt the King, and overthrow the Agreement that he had made with <hi>Leo</hi> X.

                  <p>The Pope did what lay in his Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Emperour, who had conceived a great diſpleaſure, that after he had laboured ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99003:79"/>much, and had had ſo great a hand in calling of this Council, yet the Bull ſhould be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed without asking his conſent; but, for all that, went on ſtill, to haſten the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what he had alone begun. He named three Legates to preſide in the Council: The Cardinal of <hi>Monte,</hi> called otherwiſe Cardinal of <hi>Praeneſte, Marcello Corvino</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Santa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croce,</hi> and <hi>Reynold Pool</hi> and Engliſh Man, of the Bloud-Royal of <hi>England.</hi> The firſt was Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Biſhop,</hi> the Second Cardinal <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and the Third Cardinal <hi>Deacon.</hi> The laſt was choſen more for Pomp than Neceſſity, becauſe of the Grandure of his Family, and that it might appear that though the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> had made defection from the Church, yet thoſe who continued in their Obedience were ſtill honoured and eſteemed. The Pope diſpatched the Legates, with the Bull of Legation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Plenepotentiary Bull, becauſe he would have time to conſider in what Form he ſhould give it; but ſome time after their Arrival at <hi>Trent,</hi> they received their Plenepotentiary Bull. At the ſame time the Pope made a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bull of that Nature, whereby he gave them power to adjourn the Council to any other place, if they thought fit, becauſe he was not certain whether <hi>Trent</hi> might agree with them or not; but this ſecond Bull was not then ſent, but kept ſecret. The Legates did not approve of the Plenepotentiary Bull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ordered them to proceed in all things according to the reſolutions of the Council; whereas, on the contrary, their intention was, that in all things the Council ſhould comply with them. That Place of the Bull muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99003:79"/>be mended, and there was trouble enough about it, before they could agree upon the Form of the Legates Commiſſion; there having been no precedents for ſuch kind of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In all former Councils that had been held for four or five hundred Years, the Popes always preſided in Perſon, except in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which in the beginning had the Legates of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> for Preſidents: but the Name of that Council was ſo odious to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they lookt upon it as a crime to imitate anything that had been done there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Preſidents arrive at <hi>Trent,</hi> and remain there a long while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note>The Legates arrived at <hi>Trent</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>March,</hi> two days before the Council was to be opened. The Poe had given but very ſhort warning; for there was no more than three Months betwixt the laſt Bull of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and the opening of the Council; and the remote Prelates, as the <hi>Germans, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> could not be preſent in ſo ſhort a time. However the Pope knew what he did; for it concerned him to have none there in the beginning, but <hi>Italians,</hi> and ſuch as he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of at his pleaſure: becauſe in the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, the manner of proceeding during the whole ſitting of the Council was to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thereupon depended the Authority which the Pope was to keep in his own Hands, of being Abſolute and Supreme in all the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations of that Aſſembly. The Legates in the mean time could not open the Council on the day prefixt, becauſe they found no Body at <hi>Trent;</hi> and when <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza</hi> the Emperour's Ambaſſadour came, who arrived ten days after, he found none there but the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99003:80"/>Legates and three Biſhops. In the beginning the Legates communicated to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and that ſmall Number of Biſhops, the Letters which they received from <hi>Rome,</hi> as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Act nothing without their Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it was not long ſo. The Legates per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Ambaſſadour and the Biſhops getting thereby Footing, began to meddle too much. They therefore wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> that there ſhould be always two Letters ſent them, one which might be Communicated to all, and another private for themſelves alone; they likewiſe demanded a Cipher for the ſafe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Affairs of Weight and Moment; and thus did they prepare themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the inſpirations of the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The Month of <hi>March</hi> was now ſpent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance at <hi>Trent;</hi> and the Legates were aſhamed to open a Council with no more than three Biſhops. Orders were thereupon to be expected from <hi>Rome,</hi> and whilſt they ſtayed for them, the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> arrived, and were admitted into the Congregation. Now began Diſputes about precedence to ariſe; for <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza</hi> the Emperour's Ambaſſadour challenged his place immediately after the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, before Cardinal <hi>Madoncio,</hi> otherwiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cardinal of <hi>Trent,</hi> who was preſent, and before all the Cardinals that might afterwards appear. An expedient was found out to place them ſo that none ſhould be above another, but that decided not the Controverſie; to <hi>Rome</hi> it muſt go, and thither the Legates ſent it.</p>

This Cardinal according to the Inſtructions he had received, ſolicited the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to employ open Force for the reducing of the Proteſtants; which agreed very well with the Intentions of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who thereupon diſcovered himſelf more than ever he had done before, and promiſed the Legate to take up Arms for ſuppreſſing the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> ſo ſoon as he had concluded a Truce with the <hi>Turk.</hi> At the ſame time the Cardinal nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated the ſame Affairs with the Catholicks, and eſpecially the Church-men that were at the Diet, promiſing them in the name of the Pope, money and aſſiſtance, if they would enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that holy League. Theſe Treaties were carried on under the Seal of greatest Secrecy. Nevertheleſs the Proteſtants ſuſpected ſome ſuch thing, and were the more confirmed in their conjecture, by the Indiſcretion of a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier,</hi> who Preaching before the Emperour, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Legate, turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Emperour, and told him, that by his Character and Dignity, he was obliged to defend the Church by Arms. There was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice likewiſe from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome Officers of War, made them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99003:81"/>to employ them the Year following. Theſe Preſages made the Proteſtants apprehend a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Storm a coming: the Emperour, however carried it fair, and endeavoured to perſwade the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to ſubmit to the Council, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Money for the War againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> But they looked upon this as a deſign to drain them, under pretext of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> War, that ſo they might the more eaſily be oppreſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they proteſt againſt the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and perſiſt in demanding a perpetual and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Edict of Pacification. The Emperour made anſwer, that he could not exempt them from a Council, to which all Chriſtians ought to be ſubject, and that therefore he could not grant them that Peace in the manner they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it. The truth is, he was very far from granting what they deſired, ſeeing his deſign was to make uſe of their refuſal of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Council, for a pretext of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt them as Rebels. But it was not as yet time to open his mind freely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of other important Affairs that lay upon his ſhoulders. He therefore left all things in ſuſpence, ordaining the Treaty of Peace to ſubſiſt untill the Diet which he appointed in <hi>January</hi> following to be held in the City of <hi>Ratisbonne:</hi> and for amuſing the Proteſtants, he granted a conference to be had about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion betwixt four Doctors and two Judges of each Party, to begin in <hi>December,</hi> for preparing of matters againſt the opening of the Diet. The Emperour cauſed <hi>Herman,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> to be ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at this Diet, within thirty days, either perſonally or by his Proctor; and that becauſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99003:81"/>without declaring himſelf <hi>Lutheran,</hi> he had embraced the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and had upon that Foot endeavoured to reform his Dioceſs both as to Doctrine and Diſcipline. In order whereunto, he had in the Year 1543. Aſſembled the Clergy, Nobility, and the moſt conſiderable Perſons of his Dioceſs. And though he diſowned all conformity with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> yet it was eaſie to be ſeen, that under the Name of Doctrines conſonant to the Holy Scriptures, he eſtabliſhed many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets oppoſite to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Moſt part of his Clergy oppoſed this, and appealed to the Pope as Head, and to the Emperour as Protector of the Church; which was the pretext of that Citation. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's whole Conduct in that Diet, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this laſt Action, extremely vexed the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Prelates aſſembled at <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaid openly that the Proceedings of the Emperour were ſcandalous; that to decide Affairs of Religion, appoint Conferences, name Diſputants, make Confeſſions, and Formula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith, cite Archbiſhops and Church-Men who were accuſed of Hereſie, was an evident arrogating to himſelf a Supremacy in the Church, and an Encroachment on the Council which was immediately to be opened. The truth is, throughout the whole Conduct of the Emperour, it is manifeſt that his ſole deſign was Greatneſs and the Advancement of his Authority; for he let ſlip no opportunity of invading the Rights of the Pope, and the Authority which the holy See challenges to its ſelf. The Pope was extremely netled at The Emperour's Proceedings in relation to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99003:82"/>Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> but durſt not break forth into reſentment: all he did, was to thwart that Citation by another; for he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the Archbiſhop within two Months, to appear before him in Perſon.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Pope will not have the Biſhops appear in Council by Proxy.</note>But let us now return to <hi>Trent,</hi> where the Prelates made but very ſlow progreſs. The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> had one hundred Biſhops; but the Viceroy conceiving that the abſence of ſo many Prelates, if all went to <hi>Trent,</hi> would occaſion a great ſolitude in the Church; did therefore name four to goe in their own Names, and as charged with procurations from the reſt. The Biſhops, who had all a mind to be concerned in that weighty affair, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the reſolution; and the Pope, who from time to time was to draw his recruits out of <hi>Italy,</hi> according as his occaſions did require, reſolved likewiſe to withſtand the intentions of the Viceroy, by a very ſevere Bull, which was already paſt. This Bull ordained that all who ſhould adventure to appear in Council by Proxy, ſhould <hi>ipſo facto</hi> incur the cenſure of Suſpenſion: but the Legates themſelves judged it a little too rigorous, and therefore wrote to the Pope, that he would ſuffer them to keep it ſecret.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99003:82"/>been ſtaid by ample Excuſes that were made to them, telling them that the Pope's order did not reach Perſons of the Quality and Character of their Maſter, who was both a Cardinal and a Prince. In the mean time the Legates wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> to repreſent to the Pope, the neceſſity of qualifying the ſeverity of that Bull; who ſent them back orders that they ſhould entertain the Procuratours of the Electour of <hi>Mentz</hi> with fair words, and give them the beſt ſatisfaction they could; but he durſt neither recall nor moderate his Bull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> who had, in effect, carried it againſt the Biſhops, and had got four to be deputed in name of all the reſt.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99003:83"/>and there was one reaſon that pleaded for a delay, to wit, the ſmall number of Biſhops; but there were others that urged the haſtening of it, and the Chief was, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſtop might be put to the Enterpriſes of Princes, and eſpecially to thoſe of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who upon all occaſions offered at the deciding of matters of Religion, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he might be more cautious in doing, if once the Council were opened.

Theſe delays put the Pope out of all Patience; he many times repented the calling of the Council, and if he could have done it with honour, would certainly have revoked all that had been done: thus not daring to break up and diſſolve the Council, it was ſaid, that he intended to remove it to a place where his Power and Authority was greater. At length he reſolved to ſent the Biſhop

Theſe ſmall heart-burnings how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hindred not but that the leaſt things that concerned the Glory and Authority of the Pope were carefully looked after: advice was therefore given, that in opening of the Council, the Bull that appointed it, ſhould be read; to the end that all that was done in the Council, might appear to depend on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

The twenty five Prelates that were at <hi>Trent,</hi> made a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion in their Pontificals.

The Diſcourſe of the Legates was pretty well liked, but the Biſhop's Sermon was found to be ſtuft with a pedantick and idle ſtrain of Eloquence.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99003:85"/>promiſed a Spirit of Prophecy and Infallibility to men that might be as wicked as <hi>Balaam</hi> or <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> but nothing was taken worſe of this Oratour, than when he compared the Council to the <hi>Trojan</hi> horſe, into the body of which all Biſhops ought to enter.

Theſe Ceremonies being over, the Decree was read, and all that was done in that firſt Seſſion, was the putting the queſtion to the Prelates; Are ye willing that the Council be opened? to which they all anſwered, <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet:</hi> the next Seſſion was appointed to be the ſeventh of <hi>January</hi> following; and this being done the Legates wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the way of Conſulting, Voting and Concluding, that was to be obſerved in the Council. For inſtance, if the Perſons of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and their Hereſies ſhould be condemned at one and the ſame time, what Seal ſhould be made uſe of, and eſpecially if the Votes ſhould be taken by the individual Perſons, or by the Nations they belonged to; this laſt way had been practiſed in the Councils of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that is to ſay, the Votes paſt there by Nations. In expectation of an anſwer, the Prelates were amuſed with the conſideration of very trivial matters, as what manner of Cloaths the Prelates ſhould wear out of Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-days; if they ſhould appear in ſecular Habits or otherwiſe. At length the anſwer came, which ordered the Legates not to make too

The Pope ſent alſo Money to his poor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and made no Myſtery of it as if he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be accuſed of having bought Votes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid he, when a Council is aſſembled, the Head of the Church is obliged to ſuch Works of Charity.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What was the form of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and what had been that of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councils.</note>When the Pope's Anſwer was come, the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> began to propoſe to the Prelates the order wherein matters were to be examined, before they ſhould be brought to concluſion, and ſentence paſt thereon. He went not ſo far back as the ancient Councils for a Pattern; but ſtoptat the laſt Council of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> that was called againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> II. where himſelf had aſſiſted in quality of Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto.</hi> Certainly if a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del had been borrowed from the Ancient. Church, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> would not have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the method that they followed, for there is nothing more different than the ancient and modern Councils. In the firſt Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the fervour of the Zeal and Charity of the primitive Chriſtians, eaſily put an end to the little differences that ſprung up in the Church, without ſuch great Aſſemblies; they met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ceremony, and without any great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Forms; every one gave his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99003:86"/>according as God gave him knowledge and put it into his heart, and the ancienteſt or ableſt Man preſided by Election. When the Church had weathered the Storms of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Emperours took upon them the Care of its Government; they called Councils, and either preſided in them themſelves, or by their Ambaſſadours, nay and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced interlocutory Decrees in differences that occurred. Thus <hi>Conſtantine</hi> moderated the Council of <hi>Nice. Marcellinus</hi> repreſented the ſame Emperour at the Conference which was held in <hi>Africa</hi> betwixt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts. Candidian</hi> preſided in the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in the Name of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger. The Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> was perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> termed <hi>Pogonatus,</hi> in that of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> which was held in the Palace, and is called <hi>in Trullo.</hi> It was the chief Magiſtrate then, who preſcribed the form, commanding ſome to ſpeak and others to be ſilent. In thoſe days there was no diſtinction made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Congregations and Seſſions; when they met it was to give their opinions concerning the differences that were to be decided, or the Doctrine they were to judge of: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they made an end in one Seſſion; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more were required. The Diſputes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations and Conferences which were held for clearing of matters, were termed the Acts of the Council, as well as the Deciſions and Canons: they were not kept ſecret, but freely communicated to all: but in later Councils affairs are much altered: Princes have been wholly excluded and deprived of all right of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99003:86"/>ſitting in Councils as Judges; they onely now aſſiſt as Witneſſes and Spectatours. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore even Lay-men, though they were not Princes, were admitted; but the Church-men now have driven them thence. The Popes have taken to themſelves the Power of calling Councils, and deprived Sovereigns of the ſame. By a diſtinction heretofore unknown, the Congregations are diſtinguiſhed from Seſſions: the Congregations have been appointed for debating, examining and reſolving on, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the Seſſions onely for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of publiſhing the Points that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon in the Congregations. In fine, it hath been given out, that onely the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Canons ought to paſs for the Acts of the Council: And therefore it is that all the Debates and Conferences of <hi>Trent</hi> have been ſuppreſſed, and nothing publiſhed but the Decrees thereof; with deſign to keep from the knowledge of the publick, the heats and diverſity of Sentiments which broke out, with no ſmall ſcandal during the whole ſitting of that Council.</p>
                  <p>The Pattern then of proceeding in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was taken from the later occidental Councils, and eſpecially from the laſt Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi> It was reſolved upon, that matters should be examined privately in Aſſemblies called Congregations, that in the publick Seſſions all things might be carried decently and without Conteſt. The Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were likewiſe diſtinguiſhed into Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and General; when a matter had been canvaſſed in Particular Congregations appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Preſidents, it was reported to a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99003:87"/>General Congregation of all the Prelates, where it was ſully determined. At length the matters concluded upon were publiſhed, and this was done with great Ceremony in the Cathedral-church, where after Maſs and Sermon, one Prelate in preſence of all the reſt read the Decrees, and the others gave no other Vote but <hi>placet</hi> or <hi>non placet.</hi>

This was ſo much time gained, during which the Legates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded Letters from <hi>Rome.</hi> They had wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> to know if the Pope would be ſatisfied that they ſhould remit any thing as to the words in the Title, <hi>repreſenting the Univerſal Church:</hi> but in particular they acquainted him that they were informed by Cardinal <hi>Pacieco,</hi> that the Emperour had enjoyned the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops to repair to the Council, and that therefore it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſend ten or twelve truſty <hi>Italian</hi> Prelates, on whom
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99003:88"/>he might rely, to be oppoſed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were to come: becauſe the <hi>Italians</hi> who were then at <hi>Trent</hi> were men of no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt nor authority.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Congregation was held the eighteenth of <hi>January,</hi> where opinions were given about the method of handling the three above mentioned Heads. The <hi>Germans</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that there could be no hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the extirpation of Hereſies, before the Church was reformed, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before all things, they ſhould ſet about a Reformation. The others, though in very ſmall number, were for taking a quite oppoſite Courſe, and that they ſhould begin with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith. There was a third party of opinion that they ſhould treat of Doctrine and Reformation at one and the ſame time, which opinion prevailed in the Sequel: but it was not the Legates intention that any thing ſhould be concluded in that Congregation; they therefore broke it up, and referred the matter to another time. This, indeed, was reſolved upon, that the Congregations ſhould be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly held twice a week, to wit, <hi>Munday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> to avoid farther trouble in calling them.</p>
                  <p>The Legates wrote again to <hi>Rome,</hi> urging that they might at length have inſtructions ſent them, as had been promiſed, and money for the poor Biſhops, becauſe they could no longer amuſe the Prelates with Preliminaries, that the time of the third Seſſion drew nigh, and no body could tell what might be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it. The Pope was in no haſte, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was leaſt in his thoughts; for he was wholly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99003:89"/>bent upon a War, which Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> had the year before concluded with the Emperour, againſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A great party of the Council are for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; but the Legates oppoſe it.</note> During theſe delays that party of the Prelates which was for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the actions of the Council by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Diſcipline grew ſtrong: and that was quite contrary to the intentions of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which aimed onely at the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> and dreaded a Reformation. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates therefore, who had for a long time dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly evaded that propoſition, were at length forced to oppoſe it openly in a Congregation of the twenty ſecond of <hi>January;</hi> and made uſe of this reaſon that ſtood them in great ſtead, That the Emperour had promiſed the Proteſtants that if the Council made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the deciſion of Controverſies, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would call a Diet to end all differences in Religion. They therefore alledged that if they did not firſt meddle with matters of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, they could not hinder the <hi>Germans</hi> from taking a courſe of their own, without expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Deciſions of the Council. In was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concluded, that the matter of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of Doctrine,<note place="margin">A debate about the Seal, that the Council was to uſe for their Letters.</note> ſhould goe hand in hand together; there aroſe alſo ſome debates about the Seal which the Council ſhould make uſe of in ſealing the Letters that they might have occaſion to write to the Pope, to give him thanks, and to Kings to invite them to ſend their Prelates to the Council. Moſt part were for the Councils having a Seal, and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have it of Lead, with the Image of the holy Ghoſt on one ſide, and the name of the Council on the Reverſe: others propoſed other forms; but the Legates had no mind to any
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99003:89"/>of them, they cunningly told them there was no Engraver at <hi>Trent,</hi> that they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſend to <hi>Venice,</hi> which would be tedious; and that it were better at preſent to make uſe of the chief Legate's Seal. This ſeemed to be no great matter, but however there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it; for the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were not for the Councils having a proper Seal, that ſo all its Authority might in every thing ſeem to depend on the Pope. Inferiour and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Courts ſeal their orders with the Seal of the Prince, and they had a mind to bring the Council to that. And thus did the Legates find ways of amuſing the Prelates that they might gain time, according to the Pope's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, till their inſtructions were ſent them. But in this they found no matter, that could deſerve a deciſion: the day of the Seſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and they could not imagine what excuſe to make; ſince they intended neither to treat of any Article of Doctrine, nor of Reformation. At length Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very ſeaſonable expedient;<note place="margin">To amuſe the Council the Creed is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</note> that in that Seſſion the ſymbol of the Creed of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to be confirmed and publiſhed. The ſharper ſighted alledged that it was to expoſe the Council to deriſion, to publiſh and confirm a Creed, which for twelve hundred years had been univerſally received in the Church, at a time when there were ſo many controverſies to be determined. But that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had no effect; and the Legates were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed to have found out that Biaſs, to take them off from litigious conteſts. The Decree paſt upon it notwithſtanding all the oppoſition of thoſe who ſaid, that after the purſuits and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99003:90"/>negotiations of twenty years, they were now at length aſſembled to hear the rehearſal of the Creed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Third Seſſion.</note>The Seſſion was held the fourth of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the Prelates went in body to the Church with the uſual Ceremonies, though in ſecular habit; but took their Pontificals when they came into the Church. <hi>Peter Tagliava</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Palermo</hi> officiated, and <hi>Ambroſio Catarino</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Monk made the Sermon. Afterwards according to the Decree of the Council the Creed was read, with a Preface importing, that therein they imitated the ancient Councils, which ſecured themſelves with that ſhield againſt Hereſies, before they began to act any thing. Then was read the other Decree whereby the next Seſſion was appointed to be the eighth of <hi>April,</hi> that is two Months after. The Legates uſed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for that long interval, that it behoved them to expect the coming of many Prelates who were on their Journey to the Council.</p>

                     </note>The opening of the Council and the ſmall matters that were acted in it, hindered not but that the affairs of Religion proceeded in the ſame manner as before in <hi>Germany:</hi> the Reformation advanced in ſome ſtates, whilſt it was oppoſed in others.

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99003:90"/>and the Count of <hi>Furſtemberg</hi> to preſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in his name. But it had no happy iſſue; for the Emperour's own Deputies, without doubt according to the inſtructions and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Maſter, who had no other deſign by theſe conferences, but to amuſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and give Jealouſie to the Pope, firſt croſt and then broke it off. However his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being to find a pretext of War with the Proteſtants, he made a great noiſe about the rupture of that conference, came to <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> in Perſon, wrote and complained of it to all the Princes of the Empire. The ſame year <hi>Martin Luther</hi> died in his great Climacterick, being ſixty three years of age, on the tenth of <hi>February.</hi> The death of this Man filled all the Catholicks with Joy, who verily believed that the great work of the pretended Reformation would certainly fall to the ground, after the death of him that firſt ſet his hand to it. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> looked upon that accident as a preſage that Hereſie ſhould be overthrown by its Authority, ſince that in the beginning of its Actions, the great <hi>Haereſiarcha</hi> was fallen. But ſuch kind of Prognoſticks are not always certain, as experience hath demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>After the third Seſſion which was held the fourth of <hi>February,</hi> the Legates wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">At length they prepare to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of matters, and chuſe that of the Scriptures.</note> ſhewing the impoſſibility of holding the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council any longer in ſuſpence, or of putting them off with trifles, as had been done till then. The Pope therefore at length gave conſent, that they ſhould ſet to work in good earneſt, and the Legates were of opinion that they ought firſt to begin with the ſubject of the Scripture. The Council had been in doubt,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99003:91"/>where to begin for confuting and cenſuring the Doctrine of <hi>Luther;</hi> ſome were for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the order of the confeſſion of <hi>Ausbourg;</hi> but others thought that that would be too great an honour for the Confeſſion: they liked better to have abſtracts made of their Books, and to follow the order that the Divines ſhould think moſt proper. The Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that they intended to condemn, was reduced to four Heads. The firſt was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſufficiency of holy Scriptures, and the neceſſity of Traditions; the ſecond of the Canonical Books, and their number; the third was about the Authority of the Vulgar Tranſlation, and the neceſſity of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Originals; the fourth related to the Intelligibleneſs and Perſpicuitie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſenſe that it ought to be taken in, and the Interpreters that were to be followed. Beſides theſe there was a fifth Article propoſed to be examined, to wit, if theſe matters ſhould be condemned with <hi>Anathema's.</hi> There wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Council about thirty Divines, moſt part Monks, who till then had been of no uſe but in making ſome Sermons in praiſe of the Pope and Council: but now there is work cut out for them; for they were employed to open the matters, and to make the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the controverſies; and hereupon they diſcourſed in Congregations appointed for that purpoſe, in preſence of the Prelates, who afterward gave their Judgment upon what they had learnt in the Congregations of the Divines. But the Divines had no Vote, in conſulting and forming the Decrees. The heads above mentioned were therefore ſtated
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99003:91"/>in the Congregation, and left to the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Divines. As to the firſt head, that concerned traditions, they were almoſt all very well agreed, that they ought to be received as a part of the revelation of God's Will.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Antony Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinier</hi> is not of opinion that the neceſſity of Traditions ſhould be made a point of faith.</note> But <hi>Antony Marinier</hi> a <hi>Carmelite</hi> Monk ſtarted a conſiderable opinion; he did not think it pertinent to make that a point of Faith, becauſe for aſſerting the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Traditions, one of theſe two things muſt be granted, Either that God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to write the whole revelation of his will, or that the Prophets and Apoſtles had written their books at random, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of tranſmitting that revelation by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that hence it was that part of that revelation had been written, and the reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written: he urged that the firſt could not be proved, to wit, that God had for bidden to commit all his revelation to writing; and that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was injurious to providence, which gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both the Conduct and Pen of theſe holy Writers. He gave therefore his opinion, that they ſhould follow the Courſe of the Fathers, who had made uſe of Traditions when there was occaſion, without making their neceſſity a matter of Faith. This opinion was not at all like, and Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> one of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates cenſured it ſeverely, ſaying that it had been ſitter to have been ſtarted in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> than in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Four opinions about the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Books.</note>Upon the Article of the Canonical Books, there were four opinions: ſome were for ranking them into two Claſſes, that in the firſt ſhould be placed the Books which had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99003:92"/>never been conteſted, and in the ſecond, thoſe which had; this was the Opinion of <hi>Luigi di Catanea</hi> a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> who grounded it upon the Authorities of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who had both done ſo: ſome were for having them divided into three Orders; the firſt, of thoſe whereof no doubt was ever made; the ſecond, of thoſe which had been heretofore queſtioned, but which now are received; and the third, of thoſe of which no perfect Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty was ever pretended to. The third opinion was for reducing them into a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue without any diſtinction; and, in a word, ſome were for naming expreſly thoſe Books that had been controverted, to the end they might be declared Canonical. The Book of <hi>Baruch</hi> gave them more trouble than the reſt, becauſe no Pope, nor Council had ever cited it for Canonical: but a certain Perſon made a ſhamefull remark, that the Church read part of it in the Desk, and that was enough to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize it.</p>
                  <p>By the Eighth of <hi>March</hi> the Divines had made an end of their Conferences about the Articles propoſed to them: and next day the Prelates aſſembled in Congregation, to conſult, conclude, and form the Decrees.

                        <hi>Vergerio</hi> drawn over by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> at length open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares himſelf.</note> as to the written word, and referred to another time the point concerning Canonical Books; ſome days after <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo,</hi> the ſecond of the Emperour's Ambaſſadours Collegue to <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> came to <hi>Trent:</hi> and the ſame time <hi>Vergerio</hi> who had a Biſhoprick bordering on <hi>Germany</hi> arrived there alſo. This
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99003:92"/>man was famous for many Nunciatures that he performed in <hi>Germany;</hi> and ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which he had with <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> by Commiſſion from the Pope. But inſtead of convincing the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in theſe Conferences, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had convinced him: and <hi>Vergerio</hi> had not ſo well diſguiſed his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but that he had raiſed himſelf an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, one <hi>Fryar Hannibal</hi> an Inquiſitour, who ſtirred up a Sedition of the People of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs againſt him. He came therefore to the Council to juſtifie himſelf, but was ill recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and referred to the Pope. Inſtead of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> he reſolved to return to his Biſhoprick, hoping to find the Tumult quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the <hi>Nuncio</hi> that was at <hi>Venice</hi> ſent him orders to the contrary, and was preparing to proceed againſt him, by order of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> In ſine, <hi>Vergerio</hi> took the Courſe of declaring himſelf openly, and retreating into a place of ſafety: he fled into the Countrey of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> where he made a publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrine, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wrote many things againſt the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the Congregation of the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> it was ordained that all the Canonical Books of Scripture ſhould be equally approved of, and no diſtinction made amongſt them: but there happened great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates about the vulgar Tranſlation. <hi>Luigi di Catanea</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> was of opinion, that the method of Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> ought to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had recourſe to the Greek and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew texts, and had them interpreted to him word for word, becauſe he underſtood not the Languages. This Cardinal was wont in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99003:93"/>his laſt days to ſay, that they who contented themſelves with the Latin text, had not the word of God pure, and without mixture of errours; this <hi>Jacobin</hi> ſtood ſtiff for the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals againſt Tranſlations; but the Plurality of Votes were for the vulgar Latin, and for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its Authority to be abſolutely eſtabliſhed without any reſerve. And ſome were even for having it declared, that the Authour of that Tranſlation was guided by a Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. One reaſon that influenced the Patrons of the vulgar Tranſlation was, that if they re-eſtabliſhed the original Greek and Hebrew in their ancient Authority, the Grammarians would for the future be the Maſters of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, and the Divines and Inquiſitours be obliged to learn the Languages. But there were ſome learned men in that Aſſembly, who could not endure to have it ſaid, that the Latin interpreter had a Spirit of Prophecy: <hi>Iſidorus Clarius</hi> a <hi>Breſſian</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> an able man and verſed in the knowledge of Languages, refuted that opinion; he gave a Hiſtory of that verſion, and ſhew'd it to be made up of an ancient Latin Tranſlation, which was called the <hi>Italick,</hi> and the verſion of St. <hi>Jerome;</hi> he endeavoured to prove that it was not the work of one man, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that it being made up of pieces patcht together, he concluded that it was not at all likely, that all who had laboured therein, were inſpired; adding withall, that it was evident enough that theſe different Authours were not infallible, ſince many faults were to be found in that Tranſlation. It was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſtill his opinion, that it ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99003:93"/>before all other verſions, provided it were firſt corrected. <hi>Andreas de Vega</hi> was of the ſame mind, that there were faults in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tranſlation; but was, notwithſtanding, of the opinion that it ſhould be declared Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, without prejudice to any to conſult the Originals. They proceeded next to the Article of the ſenſe and interpretation of Scripture. It was thought that the liberty that men had taken to themſelves in theſe later years of interpreting Scripture, was the cauſe of the Hereſies in <hi>Germany:</hi> And therefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil purpoſed to remedy that, by barring private men from expounding the Scriptures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their fancy. Some were for admitting all modern interpretation, provided it were not contrary to the Faith, and that opinion <hi>Cajetan</hi> had maintained. Others thought that ſome liberty might be allowed to diverſity of interpretation, provided they did not claſh and contradict one another; and theſe laſt approved the remark of Cardinal <hi>di Cuſa,</hi> who heretofore ſaid that Scripture ought to be interpreted variouſly, according to the times, and the Hereſies that are to be confuted. But moſt part were of a contrary opinion, and judged it neceſſary to confine Expoſitours to the Interpretations of the Fathers, and not to admit of any new expoſitions. A <hi>Cordelier</hi> of <hi>Mons</hi> called <hi>Richard,</hi> went a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther, and ſaid that the Holy Scripture was not now any longer neceſſary for teaching Divinity, which is ſufficiently to be found in the Books of the School-men; and that at preſent Scripture was not to be read for the inſtruction of the People, but onely for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The concluſion, at length, of all theſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99003:94"/>diſputes was, that the vulgar Tranſlation was declared Authentick, with a proviſo that it ſhould be corrected, and Deputies were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make the amendments. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after, the Pope put a ſtop to that work which was begun, and cauſed it to be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red untill new orders; in fine, all liberty of broaching any new ſenſe of Scripture different from that of the Fathers, was taken away.</p>
                  <p>In the Congregation of the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> the queſtion was debated, whether Canons and <hi>Anathema's</hi> were to paſs upon theſe points; ſome there were that thought it very hard to declare Hereticks and pronounce <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s againſt thoſe who might queſtion the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of the vulgar Tranſlation, and take the liberty to obſerve faults in it; but an expedient was found, which was, to make a Canon touching the neceſſity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and the number of Canonical books with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, and to refer the vulgar Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, and what concerned the interpretation of Scripture to the Chapter of Reformation where none were to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of this it was moved, that means ought to be found to put a ſtop to the bad uſe that Libertines and profane People make of the Holy Scriptures; ſome in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical operations, and others in defamatory Libels, where they pervert texts of Scripture by wicked and impious Applications. The Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> was very hot about this, being much concerned at the <hi>Paſquinades</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of the Diſorders of his Life. At length it was reſolved that a Decree ſhould be made, whereby, without deſcending to particulars, ſuch kinds of abuſes ſhould be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99003:94"/>Prohibited in general terms, and all Printers forbid to print them.</p>

The Emperour who valued not the Ordinances of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as they made for his intereſt, did not immediately upon this excommunication break with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop; but for ſometime continued to treat with him as Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne;</hi> becauſe he was afraid that if he put him too hard to it, he might join in War with the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates againſt him, whereas till then he had perſevered in his Obedience. So that that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence did no great harm to the Archbiſhop; but wrought pernicious effects in the minds of the Proteſtants, and thoſe that favoured them. This does evidently demonſtrate, ſay they, that the Council ſignifies no more than a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Convocation, ſeeing People are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for Doctrines which ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main undecided, untill the Council have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a definitive Sentence.

                  <p>The Synodal actions were again renewed in the Council, that the matters might be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which were to be Judged in the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Pope had enjoyned his Legates to ſet on foot the queſtion of original ſin; but the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99003:95"/>
                     <hi>Germans</hi> oppoſed it, and would have them to fall upon the matter of Reformation. <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo</hi> inſiſted ſo much thereupon, in the Emperour's name, that the Legates were forced to tell him in plain terms, that they had expreſs orders from the Pope not to meddle with the matter of Reformation; and becauſe the Ambaſſadour was not ſatisfied with that anſwer, but continued his Inſtances, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates wrote about it to <hi>Rome.</hi> Whilſt they ſtayed for new Orders from thence, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome regulations to be made about the manner of proceeding, that matters might be carried more orderly. It was ordained, that for the future, three kinds of Congregations ſhould be held, one wherein the Divines ſhould examine matters of Doctrine; the other for handling the affair of Reformation, into which the Doctors of the Canon Law ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and laſtly, a third ſort which was onely to conſiſt of Prelates, to form the Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Doctrine and Reformation. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>Germans,</hi> who deſired that the matter of Reformation of Diſcipline ſhould be taken in hand before all things elſe, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates gave way to the reſuming the matter of Lectures and Preaching; which had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready moved before the laſt Seſſion,<note place="margin">A conſiderable debate on the ſubject of Preaching, the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Fryars having invaded the Pulpits.</note> and had been referred to another time. The great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Clergy, and the ſupine igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Prieſts in paſt ages, was the cauſe that the Biſhops and Prieſts who had the cure of Souls, did wholly abandon the care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and the charge of Preaching. The Colleges and <hi>Mendicant</hi> Fryars ſeized the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits which they found empty, and obtained
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99003:96"/>privileges from Popes to Preach every where without the Permiſſion of the Ordinaries, that is, of the Biſhops; and the Monks had now a poſſeſſion of two or three hundred years to confirm their Title. The Biſhops beſtirred themſelves vigorouſly to recover the poſſeſſion of their rights, and demanded the revocation of thoſe privileges: the Monks defended their cauſe, and many writings and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates were thereupon occaſioned on both ſides. The Divines and Canoniſts were conſulted, and moſt part gave their opinions in writing: the Legates, in the mean time, under pretence that the reading of theſe Papers would take up too much of the Councils time, cauſed an abſtract of them to be made, which ſhould be read in a ſolemn and general Congregation. But becauſe that abridgement was probably defective or partial, one <hi>Braccio Martello,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole,</hi> oppoſed the reading of it, and ſpoke with a great deal of freedom: he told them plainly that their deliberations ought not to come packt to them from other places, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rome,</hi> nor that it was fit that two or three Perſons ſhould be the ſole Arbitrators in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, intimating the Legates ; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary that all ſhould hear the reaſons, and that in their full extent, that they might be the more able to comprehend their ſtrength, and paſs their Judgment upon them in the aſſembly. This diſcourſe choaked the Legates, who not onely rebuked him upon the ſpot, but wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> alſo to have him ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Council, and the Biſhop of <hi>Chioza</hi> prohibited to return thither any more. This laſt Biſhop had had a little too bold diſpute
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99003:96"/>with the Legate <hi>Pool</hi> concerning the opinion of <hi>Antony Marinier</hi> the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> touching Traditions: he had defended the opinion of the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> complaining that there was no liberty allowed in the Council, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that, he had abſented himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Seſſion, under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indiſpoſed. The Pope, however, was more prudent than the Legates; for though he was no leſs reſolved than they to oppreſs the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Council, yet he thought it fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve meaſures, and to wink at the actions of thoſe two Biſhops. The abſtract was then read, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole;</hi> and the Biſhops alledged their reaſons, upbraiding the predicant Monks with Avarice, with the Collections and Alms which they erogated under colour of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing Souls. The Monks, on the other hand, pleaded that they could not be accuſed of Uſurpation, ſince by permiſſion from the chief Paſtor of the Church, they had ſtept into the Pulpits, which they found forſaken. This Article, as well as others, muſt wait for its deciſion from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope wrote to the Legates, that they ſhould endeavour to maintain the privileges of the Univerſities and Monks; but withall find out ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to ſatisfie the Biſhops. But if the Biſhops intended to make themſelves abſolute Maſters within their Dioceſſes, to the prejudice of the exemptions granted by the Popes, that they ſhould not fail to oppoſe it, and to defend the Monks againſt the Biſhops; becauſe the Monks depending immediately on the holy See, have been always the chief ſupports of its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99003:97"/>and have been very uſefull for bringing down the Biſhops. The expedient which was, at length found, was to re-eſtabliſh, according to the ancient cuſtome, in Cathedral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a Doctor of Divinity for reading of Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The name of that office was ſtill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Cathedral Churches; for there was one in the chapter called the <hi>Scholaſticus,</hi> to whoſe office there was a Prebend annexed, as being chief of the Lecturers, and he himſelf ought to be a Profeſſour of Divinity, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendance of that affair was without any difficulty granted to the Biſhops. But it was not ſo eaſie a matter to allow them the ſame power over Monaſteries, wherein they alſo intended to re-eſtabliſh the cuſtome of Lectures of Divinity, for inſtructing thoſe to Houſe. The Legates could not endure that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould have the overſight of that, though the buſineſs was not about the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, but onely ſimple Monks, for fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from the privileges that had been granted by the Popes, and of emancipating the Monaſteries from the holy See, to ſubject them again to the Biſhops. Whilſt they were ſticking at this point,<note place="margin">A conſiderable overture of <hi>Sebaſtiano Pighino,</hi> for contenting the Biſhops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See.</note> 
                     <hi>Sebaſtiano Pighino</hi> Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the <hi>Rota</hi> made an overture that brought the Council out of theſe difficulties. His opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was that the Biſhops ought to have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to re-eſtabliſh the Lectures of Theology in Monaſteries, not in quality of Biſhops, but as Delegates of the holy See: that is to ſay, that they ſhould act in that affair by the Pope's Authority, and as it were, in his name. It is incredible of what uſe this invention was in the ſequel of the Council; and it was a fetch
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99003:97"/>always employed when any thing was to be reſtored to the Biſhops, without diminution of the Authority which the Pope had uſurped over them. That ſo well contrived expedient was preſently laid hold of; for it was Enacted that Parochial Churches united to Monaſteries, and which depended on no Dioceſs, ſhould for the future be under the Direction of the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> as Delegate of the holy See. In like manner becauſe there were Preachers who had obtained privileges from <hi>Rome</hi> to anſwer to none but the Pope, it was ordained that they might be puniſhed by the Biſhops in the ſame quality of Commiſſioners delegated by the Pope.</p>
                  <p>As to the matter of Preaching, the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was continued to the Monks: but to give ſome ſatisfaction to the Biſhops, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that it ſhould be in their power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or reject thoſe religious Preachers, when they offered to Preach in other Churches than thoſe of their Order, and that the Monks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could Preach, even in their own Churches, ſhould be obliged to receive the Biſhops Benediction: and in ſhort, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops might puniſh the religious Preachers, and ſuſpend them from Preaching, in caſe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Scandal. The Generals of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were not over well ſatisfied with theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, but the Legates found means to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe them.<note place="margin">The Council enters upon the matter of Original ſin, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Germans.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Legates having received new orders from the Pope to handle the matter of Original ſin, ſet about the execution of that Commiſſion. Cardinal <hi>Pacieco</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99003:98"/>all the Imperialiſts, withſtood it again, but all to no purpoſe, for the matter muſt be ſo.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing they did, was to propoſe the errours that were to be condemned, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into nine Articles. But for the convenience of Diſpute, before theſe nine Articles were condemned, it was thought fit to reduce the whole matter to four principal heads;
<list>
                        <item>the firſt, what was <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin;</item>
                        <item>the ſecond, what is it that is derived from him to his poſterity;</item>
                        <item>the third, in what manner that ſin is tranſmitted to his deſcendants;</item>
                     </list> and the laſt, how it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and forgiven. As to the firſt head it was agreed, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin loſt his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal righteouſneſs and innocence; that by the loſs of that innocence came the diſobedience of the affections, and the rebellion of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which the Scripture calls Concupiſcence. They likewiſe agreed that theſe evils could not properly be called the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe they are the effects and puniſhments of his ſin, rather than the ſin it ſelf. So that they defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> conſiſted properly in the action which he had committed againſt tho command of God: and here they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the liberty to enlarge, and diſpute about the nature and kind of that action, to wit, whether it was pride or infidelity, gluttony or ſimple diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>They found more difficulty about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head, to wit, what it is that is derived from the firſt man unto his poſterity. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many different opinions aroſe; ſome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſentiment of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who will have concupiſcence to be the original ſin deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Adam:</hi> The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> were of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99003:98"/>opinion, of <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> who ſay that the privation of original Righteouſneſs is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly original Sin, and not Concupiſcence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Concupiſcence remains after Baptiſm, which purgeth away original Sin. Moſt part of the <hi>Jacobins</hi> were of the Judgment of their own St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who thinks that the privation of original Righteouſneſs, and Concupiſcence made up original Sin, ſo that the privation of original Righteouſneſs, is as the form, and Concupiſcence as the matter.</p>
                  <p>As to the third head that relates to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how that Sin is tranſmitted to the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendents of the firſt Man, as the matter is more obſcure, ſo the Divines found themſelves more puzled about it; all the various opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the School-men were offered; and each of them had its adherents: but that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned no great Debates; no more than the fourth head, which reſpected the manner how original Sin is pardoned and forgiven: They all agreed, that it is fully blotted out by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and that thereby the Soul becomes as pure as the Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was in the State of Innocence; there was nevertheleſs ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute betwixt <hi>Ambroſio Catarino</hi> and <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> about the Nature of original Sin: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarino</hi> maintained that the privation of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs, and Concupiſcence could not be the true original Sin, becauſe theſe are rather the Puniſhments of Sin than the Sin it ſelf; and therefore he pretended that the Action of <hi>Adam</hi> was ſolely and properly original Sin, and that that Action was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Poſterity by imputation, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant that God had made with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99003:99"/>
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> at that time when he repreſented all Mankind, and acted in the Name of all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; he moreover denied that the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin could either be tranſmitted by the Soul or by the Body; becauſe the Body, according to the ſuppoſition of that Divine, can neither act upon the Soul, nor the Soul upon the Body, <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> defended the opinion of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſaid that after the Commiſſion of Sin there remains a ſtain and inherent quality, and that that ſtain and that corrupt quality deſcends from Parents to their Children.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt they were diſputing about theſe four heads, the Council at the ſame time were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cenſuring of the nine Articles, that had been propoſed in the beginning, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the relation they ſtood in to the four heads that were under examination. The two firſt Articles that were propoſed to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, denied original Sin, or made it onely to be derived to Children by way of imitation,<note place="margin">The Council cenſures the nine Articles of Doctrine which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants about original Sin.</note> and were without difficulty condemned as hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Not that they were found in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Luther,</hi> but they thought that they had found in the Writings of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> that he believed not original Sin. However the more intelligent and leſs paſſionate having well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his expreſſions were of opinion that his deſign was not to deny the propagation of that Corruption, nor the depravation of Nature; but that he onely denied that that original Corruption could be referred to that kind of beings, which are called actions, reckoning them to be onely diſpoſitions to action, which is the Sentiment of the whole Church. <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:99003:99"/>was accuſed of maintaining ſome opinions contrary to thoſe of the Church touching original Sin, and of believing that it paſt from Parents to Children onely by example and imitation. In one of the Articles taken out of the Books of <hi>Luther,</hi> they made him ſay that original Sin conſiſts in ignorance, in the contempt of God, and in the privation of the fear, affiance in, and love of God; which they looked upon to be an extremity oppoſite to that opinion of the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> So that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was not accuſed of denying original Sin, but rather of making it conſiſt in actions onely to be found in men grown up; becauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants can neither contemn nor hate God; this difficulty being often propoſed to the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> in the Conferences of <hi>Germany,</hi> they made anſwer that by theſe expreſſions they meant inclinations to the contempt and hatred of God; which ſhews that they onely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the manner of expreſſion; but becauſe the Council was reſolved to make every thing a Crime, theſe harſh expreſſions were recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt their Errours. The moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant queſtion that was diſcuſſed about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, whether original Sin remains after Baptiſm; and nevertheleſs it is hardly any thing but a conteſt about words; for all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are agreed that Concupiſcence remains after Baptiſm; and the queſtion onely is then, whether or no that Concupiſcence be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin; for if that be the remaining Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, without doubt original Sin remains alſo. So that all the queſtion comes to this, to know whether after Baptiſm Concupiſcence ought to be called Sin, as the Proteſtants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99003:100"/>or barely a decay and ſickneſs of Nature, as the Catholicks would have it; that was no very important queſtion then: and yet all were agreed, except the <hi>Carmelite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antony Marinier,</hi> that there was enough in it to faſten Hereſie on the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> He was willing to acknowledge with all the reſt, that original Sin does not remain after Baptiſm; but he thought it an exceſs of ſeverity to condemn the contrary opinion as heretical. He maintained that both the one and the other might be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that original Sin remains after Baptiſm, and that it does not remain; that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had expreſſed himſelf two manner of ways that ſeem contrary; that in his Books to <hi>Boniface,</hi> he hath ſaid that Concupiſcence was not Sin, but both the cauſe and effect of Sin; and that on the contrary in his Books againſt <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> he hath expreſly ſaid, that Concupiſcence is Sin, the cauſe of Sin, and the effect of Sin; and that therefore it was evident that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his thought, one may hold the one or other opinion without Hereſie, and ſay that Concupiſcence after Baptiſm is a Sin; or is not a Sin. This diſcourſe created many Jealouſies againſt the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> and made them ſuſpect him to be infected with <hi>Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi> and the rather becauſe he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before that, to have ſaid many things in his Sermons agreable to the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Amongſt other things he had ſaid, that we ought to put all our truſt in God, and not to rely on our works, that all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Heathens were real Sins, and that a man might have ſome aſſurance of his being in the ſtate of Grace. One of the Articles that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99003:100"/>was to be condemned, reſpected the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are due to original Sin, and to which Infants that die without Baptiſm are obnoxious. The opinion of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Rimini</hi> a famous School-man, which condemns ſuch Infants to everlaſting Torments, was unanimouſly rejected by all. The <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier</hi> Divines who were at the Council, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the place to which theſe Infants were confined was not under the Earth, but upon the Earth, and in the light; others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they were taken up in reaſoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the works of Nature, and that they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that ſatisfaction which men find in the diſcovery of curious matters. But <hi>Catarino</hi> went a great deal farther, and allotted them a kind of ſupernatural Bliſs: ſaying, that in the place where God put them, they ſhould be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by Angels and Saints: he laboured all he could to get the opinion of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but to no purpoſe. It was indeed diſapproved, but out of the reſpect that was had to that Saint, they would not declare it heretical. The ſentiment of the <hi>Jacobins</hi> which placed theſe Infants in a <hi>Limbus</hi> where they are without ſorrows and pain, but deprived of Beatitude and Joy, prevailed and was moſt approved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Prelates underſtand not the matter of original Sin, and know not how to make Decrees about it.</note>After theſe long Conferences of the Divines were over, the Prelates held their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for forming the Decrees and Canons. But they knew not how to ſet about it; for it is a thorny queſtion, and part of the Biſhops underſtood it not. Moſt part were of opinion, that they ſhould not define original Sin, nor propoſe heads of Doctrine to declare the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church concerning that matter.

But the Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia</hi> and <hi>Gieronimo Seripande</hi> General of the <hi>Auguſtines</hi> who inſiſted on that, gained no ground; for it behoved the Biſhops, before they could lay down heads of Doctrine touching that thorny queſtion, to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in it, and they reſolved not to trouble themſelves about that: though, perhaps when they had taken all the pains they could, they might not have been able ſo to have fatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the point, as to have explained it clearly.

The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> oppoſed that Sentiment untill the Year thirteen hundred, at which time <hi>Johannes Scotus,</hi> a <hi>Cordelier,</hi> made a Probleme of that opinion and judged it probable: afterward the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> puſht it on from probability to certainty, and made it almoſt an Article of Faith. On the contrary the <hi>Jacobins</hi> perſiſted in the Sentiment of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas:</hi> and this ſowed the ſeeds of a War which hath laſted three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, and does ſtill continue betwixt thoſe two Parties. The Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> hath embraced the opinion of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> ſeveral Popes have declared for it, and ſome againſt it. Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. favoured the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins,</hi> becauſe of the hatred he bore to the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who ſtood for the Party of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> whom he had excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. who was a <hi>Cordelier</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured his order, and made a Bull in the Year fourteen hundred and ſeventy four, whereby he prohibited any to cenſure the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the immaculate Conception as heretical, and confirmed the new Service that had been made for celebrating the Feſtival of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. This War continued ſtill very hot at the time of the Council: And therefore the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins</hi> endeavoured to obtain, that it might be declared in general terms without any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99003:102"/>that the Corruption of <hi>Adam</hi> was tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all men, that ſo the bleſſed Virgin might be comprehended therein. On the other part the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> pleaded that ſhe might be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the general rule. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was conſulted upon the matter, and the anſwer from thence was, that they ſhould not meddle with that controverſie: ſo that the Legates decl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ared that they were not aſſembled to pronounce upon differences that Catholicks had amongſt themſelves, but onely to condemn Hereticks. The Council therefore not to offend either of the Parties, but to ſatisfie the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> without condemning the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> added a clauſe to the end of the Decree; that it was not their intention in all that had been ſaid, to doe any prejudice to the opinion of the immaculate Conception; but that the mind of the Council was that the Conſtitution of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. ſhould be obſerved.</p>

There were two Decrees, one concerning Doctrine, and the other about Reformation; the firſt contained the five Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons againſt the errours of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and other Proteſtants about original Sin, which have been mentioned before. In the ſecond Decree there were two articles; the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Lectures of Divinity which were to be re-eſtabliſhed in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches. It ordained that in ſuch Churches
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99003:102"/>able men ſhould be choſen for making Lectures of Divinity upon the Scripture; that the ſame ſhould be done in Monaſteries; that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots ſhould take the care of that, and in caſe of their neglect that the Biſhop might compell them to it, but ſtill by a Power delegated from the holy See. And, in fine, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Divinity before they began to make their Lectures, ſhould be approved by the Biſhop, excepting thoſe of Cloyſters whom the Council did not oblige to demand that appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. The ſecond Article of the Decree of Reformation; did regulate the matter of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and Preachers. It ordained that the Biſhops ſhould preach themſelves, and that if they could not, they ſhould fill their places with men fit to inſtruct and edifie: that the Curates ſhould be obliged to make Sermons or Prones at leaſt every Sunday and all holy Days: that the Preachers who ſhould preach in Pariſhes under the Juriſdiction of Biſhops, ſhould have licence from them before they take poſſeſſion of the Pulpits: that the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in Cloyſters, ſhould at leaſt take the Biſhops Bleſſing: that if theſe Preachers ſhould prove to be Hereticks or ſcandalous, they might be ſuſpended by the Ordinaries: that if they had a Privilege from the Pope that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from the Juriſdiction of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, yet they might ſtill be ſuſpended and puniſhed by them, as Delegates of the holy See; and that the Collectours ſhould neither preach themſelves, nor cauſe others to preach up the ſale of Indulgences. This being done, the next Seſſion was appointed to be held the nine and twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> and before the

At length, he concluded with his Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, whom he commended for his Care and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in hindering the growth of Hereſie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Dominions, telling them that by the Rigour of his Edicts he had provided ſo well, that no Aſſembly of Proteſtants had as yet met within his Territories. <hi>Hercules Severolla</hi> Proctour of the Council anſwered him in a ſew words; he thanked the moſt Chriſtian King for having ſent to the Council, told the Ambaſſadour that his arrival was very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them; aſſured him that they had always had a great veneration for the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, and promiſed that the Council would on all occaſions be ready to doe her all good offices for the future.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are darting <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi> againſt the Proteſtants, the Pope and Emperour prepare another ſort of arms againſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99003:103"/>them. The treaty which the year before was begun by Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> was completed by the Cardinal of <hi>Trent,</hi> within a few days after the laſt Seſſion.<note place="margin">War is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red betwixt the Pope, the Emperour and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; the Emperour gets great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and the Pope is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Emperour.</note> In this treaty the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour obliged himſelf to reduce the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> to the obedience of the holy See, becauſe they refuſed to ſubmit to the Council. The Pope, on his part, promiſed to furniſh the Emperour with twelve thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, and two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns for the Charges of the War; beſides he permitted the Emperour to ſell of Lands belonging to Monaſteries as much as might amount to fifteen hundred thouſand Livers, and to have for one year the half of the Revenues of the Church of <hi>Spain;</hi> on condition that he ſhould have a ſhare in the advantages of the Conqueſts that ſhould be made, and that nothing ſhould be granted the Proteſtants, eſpecially in matters of Religion without the Pope's conſent; there was alſo a ſecret Article, whereby the Pope obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to excommunicate the King of <hi>France,</hi> if he took up arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> during this War. To ſtrengthen this League the Pope ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited ſeveral other Princes to enter into it, and amongſt others the Catholick <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> but they would not eſpouſe the Party. This treaty was kept ſecret betwixt them, and the Emperour deſired it ſhould be ſo, that he might the more eaſily pretend, that it was no War for Religion. He publiſhed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his manifeſto's, that he had taken up arms to reduce Rebels who by violence had invaded the Eſtates of the Church, making Abbey and Biſhops lands hereditary to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99003:104"/>and who made alliances with Strangers contrary to his own, and the intereſts of the Empire. The deſign of this Politick fetch was to retain thoſe <hi>Lutherans</hi> on his ſide, who were not engaged in League with the Confederates; and indeed ſeveral of them furniſhed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with Troops; amongſt whom were <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Brandebourg.</hi> On the other ſide the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the reſt of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants publiſhed a Manifeſto, wherein they laid open the Myſtery of that League, and ſhew'd it to be a War for Religion, of which the Pope and Council were the Authors.</p>
                  <p>This Myſtery was ſoon diſcovered, for the Pope publiſhed a Jubile at <hi>Rome</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>July,</hi> for the good Succeſs of the Arms of the Church and Emperour, which were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for reducing Hereticks to their obedience by force. In the mean time the Emperour continued to proceed upon the account of a War of State; for he Outlawed the <hi>Landgrave</hi> and Electour of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and publiſhed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation thereupon, dated the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>July;</hi> wherein he accuſed them of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſpired againſt him, of having made War againſt other Princes of the Empire, of ſeizing on Biſhopricks, of having robbed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People of their Eſtates, and having cloaked all theſe attempts under the fair pretext of Peace, Liberty and Religion: ſo that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them as ſeditious Traytors, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the publick Peace, forfeited all their Dignities, and abſolved their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance; though in all this charge there was not the leaſt word that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99003:104"/>them of Hereſie, or defection from the Church. By theſe two oppoſite Declarations which were made by the Emperour and the Pope, they were mutually vexed, and croſſed one another in the private deſigns which each of them had. All men eaſily ſaw into the meaning of this; for it was evident that the Pope had onely undertaken the War for the ruine of the Proteſtants; but on the contrary that the Emperour was not much concerned for the intereſts of the Church, if he could but advance the greatneſs of his Family. The <hi>Italians</hi> were not ſatisfied with the Pope's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; for thereby they ſaw that he afforded the Emperour means of making himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of <hi>Germany;</hi> which could not come to paſs, without expoſing the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to the ſame dint of oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Pope had a great mind to draw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage from that War, and that was of finding a pretext to diſſolve the Council. The Proteſtant Army who had a deſign to hinder the joyning of the Emperour and Pope's Forces, was advanced near the County of <hi>Tirol,</hi> which is not far from <hi>Trent.</hi> This was enough to alarm the Prelates who were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy weary of their long ſtay, and of the ſmall matters they had done. Beſides, <hi>Trent</hi> lay in the paſſage of the Troops which marched from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> to the aſſiſtance of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ſo that during the whole Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that City was continually peſtered with Souldiers, which interrupted the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Council. Thus all circumſtances ſeemed favourable for the breaking up of that Aſſembly; or, at leaſt for tranſlating it into
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99003:105"/>ſome Town in <hi>Italy;</hi> which was paſſionately deſired by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who therefore ſnatcht at all occaſions to do it. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was of another mind: the Council was uſefull to his deſigns of having a pretext to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe that would not ſubmit to it, and ſo would have it continue where it was. He therefore ſent to <hi>Trent,</hi> promiſed the Prelates to ſee to their ſafety; and becauſe the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>di Santa Croce</hi> one of the Legates enclined mightily to have the Council ſeparated, he made his Ambaſſadour threaten him, that if he ſtirred the leaſt in the affair of diſſolving or tranſlating the Council, he would cauſe him to be thrown into the River of <hi>Adige:</hi> at leaſt ſo much hath been ſaid and written by the Hiſtorians of that time. The Emperour had great ſucceſs in this War: the Armies had lain a pretty long ſpace near one another; and the Proteſtants had had many fair occaſions of gaining conſiderable advantages upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts: but they could make no uſe of them, becauſe they were commanded by two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of equal Authority; to wit, the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> This Parity in authority and command is always fatal to Armies, becauſe Jealouſie never fails to raiſe diviſion and miſunderſtanding betwixt the two Generals. However the advantages were much alike on both ſides untill the end of <hi>October,</hi> at which time the Emperour cauſed the Army of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and of his Allies under the Command of his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to march into the Territories of the <hi>Landgrave</hi> and Electour, who were the two heads of the Proteſtants.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99003:105"/>This obliged them to draw off, and to march to the defence of their own Countries: and ſo the Emperour without fighting remained Maſter of the upper <hi>Germany;</hi> and all the States in thoſe Quarters, whether Princes or Towns, ſubmitted to his Laws. He got of them a great ſupply of Artillery for his Army, and vaſt ſums of money; but in requital al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed all liberty of Conſcience, and the free exerciſe of their Religion. And now the Pope began to diſcover the true intentions of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, who gave him no ſhare in what he got, deſtroyed not the Proteſtants, but left them in full liberty as to Religion; and the forces of the Church ſerved for no other end, but to render him abſolute Maſter of <hi>Germany.</hi> Nay, he had even promiſed to Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> the Electorate of <hi>Saxony,</hi> though he was no leſs <hi>Lutheran</hi> than his Coſin. This conduct opened the Pope's eyes, and made him ſee his true intereſts. He therefore, in the firſt place recalled <hi>Alexander Farneſe,</hi> one of his Nephews, whom he had ſent as Legate with his Army, and ſome time after, about the middle of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> he commanded <hi>Octavian Farneſe</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> Son in Law to the Emperour, his other Nephew and General of his Forces, to draw them back into <hi>Italy.</hi> The Emperour complained of this; but he excuſed himſelf in that the time of ſix Months for which he had promiſed his Troops was expired, and that he was no longer able to ſupport ſo great a charge. The Proteſtants, who had ſuffered bad uſage, revenged themſelves on the Pope by publiſhing a Manifeſto againſt him, ſtuft with all ſorts of reproaches, wherein they called him Antichriſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99003:106"/>and the inſtrument of the Devil; they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of having ſent People into <hi>Germany</hi> to poiſon the Wells, and ſtanding Waters, and to ſet fire into ſeveral places in <hi>Saxony;</hi> and gave all People warning to beware of ſuch Poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Incendiaries. Though theſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not believed, but lookt upon as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies dictated by a Spirit of Revenge; the Pope however, got nothing by that Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Emperour, but trouble, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſhame, beſides the loſs of his Troops, which returned in very bad equipage.</p>
                  <p>During theſe troubles the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> were ſtill a-doeing, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded very ſlowly. The Pope and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for reaſons quite different were glad that affairs were protracted. The Emperour, becauſe he deſired that the Council might not decide the controverſies of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had made an end of the War that he was engaged in. The Pope, becauſe he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that by managing affairs ſlowly in the Council, he might at length tire out both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Prelates, and cauſe a final diſſolution of the Aſſembly. And ſo the Seſſion which was to have been held the nine and twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> was put off till the thirteenth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> following. Theſe ſeven Months were ſpent in Diſputes; for the Legates looſed the Reins to the Divines, and left them to that humour of jangling and contradiction to which they are moſt commonly too much addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Next day after the Seſſion that had been held the ſeventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Legates cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Congregation, wherein they conſulted
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99003:106"/>of the matter which was to be decided in the next Seſſion. The Pope's Divines preſented a writing to prove that after the buſineſs of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, which had been then decided,<note place="margin">The ſubject of Grace and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is choſen for the next Seſſion.</note> the next thing the Council ought to treat of, was the matter of Juſtification and Grace: becauſe it is natural to ſpeak of the remedy after one hath diſcovered the evil, that Grace is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of Original ſin; and that that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the method obſerved in the confeſſion of <hi>Ausbourg.</hi> On the other ſide the Emperour's Ambaſſadours perſiſted to urge that they ſhould not purſue the examination of Doctrine, but proceed in the matter of Reformation. The Legates told the Ambaſſadours, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways profitable to examine matters of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that it was good to be inſtructed, and that that examination ſhould not engage them in a deciſion of controverſies, but that they might afterwards be delayed as long as ſhould be deſired; and that whilſt the Divines ſhould examine the matter of Juſtification, the Biſhops and Canoniſts ſhould conſult about Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They concluded upon this, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſearch to be made into the Books of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and other Proteſtants, to pick out of them the Heretical propoſitions that ought to be condemned. In the next Congregation, the Legates, that they might be as good as their word, moved that they might conſult about Reformation.<note place="margin">Reſidence is propoſed as a point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> The Cardinal of <hi>Monte</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the point of Reſidence, and preſſed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, affirming that all the preſent troubles and diſorders of the Church ſprung from the non-reſidence of Biſhops, becauſe the vices of the Clergy, and Hereſies were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Debate about the nature of works that precede Grace. <hi>Ambroſio Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarino</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and the Proteſtants.</note>Afterwards the Divines diſputed of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of works that precede Grace: and moſt of the Votes were againſt the opinion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who affirm that all works done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith are ſins. But <hi>Ambroſio Catarino</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the defence of that opinion; he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that it was the judgment of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> He confeſſed that he had been heretofore of the ſentiment of the School-men but that he had renounced it, after that he had read the Scriptures and the Fathers; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, he cenſured the vain ſubtilty, of the School-Divines, who abandoning the Scripture and the Fathers, ſuffered themſelves to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the falſe light of Philoſophy. He backed his aſſertion with the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>a bad tree cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi> and with thoſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays. <hi>To be unclean all things are unclean. Dominico à Soto,</hi> a great Enemy of the Doctrine of Grace, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Catarino</hi> with ſo much Paſſion that he called him Heretick, and accuſed him of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying free will as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did. For his part he maintained that Infidels might fulfill all the Law; that is to ſay, that they might doe all the good works that are commanded, though they did them not for the ends for which they have been commanded, to wit, the glory of God, and eternal Salvation; but he maintained that it was ſufficient for doing an action without ſin, to obſerve the ſubſtance
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99003:107"/>of the commandment. He therefore aſſerted that without Grace one might avoid all ſins, and that he might a little correct the expreſſion which ſeemed <hi>Pelagian,</hi> he added that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace one might very well avoid every ſin conſidered ſeparately, but not all ſins taken together. Juſt, ſaid he, as one may ſtop all the holes of a leaky Ship in a hundred places, if you conſider them ſeparately; yet not be able to ſtop them all when you take them all together, becauſe one cannot be in all places, and whilſt one is buſied in ſtopping of one, the water gets in by the reſt. The <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> of the School had taken ſuch deep rooting in the minds of many, that they did not even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that exception of <hi>Soto</hi>'s; they would have had it allowed without diſtinction, that men without the aſſiſtance of Grace are able to ſhun all ſins.</p>
                  <p>In the next place they examined the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,<note place="margin">A diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to grace, and the merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity.</note>if works performed without Grace are preparations for Juſtification. If <hi>Dominico à So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> durſt have ſtuck to his principles, having with ſo much vehemence aſſerted the goodneſs of ſuch works, he could not but have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they were immediate preparations for Grace; but he durſt not, becauſe of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and eſpecially becauſe of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> of whoſe Doctrine he made profeſſion. And therefore he fell off, and ſaid for juſtification. But the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> who preferred their own <hi>Scotus</hi> before St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſtep, and maintained that they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate diſpoſitions, and even merited juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>Scotus</hi> was the great Champion for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99003:108"/>this Merit of Congruity, according to whom the School-men ſaid, that it was ſuitable to the juſtice and goodneſs of God to aſſiſt him that does all he can, according to the Maxime, <hi>facienti quod in ſe eſt Deus non deeſt;</hi> ſince that time they have reſtrained this Merit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to works that are performed by preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace, before the infuſion of juſtifying grace; but before the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> the School was more than Demi-pelagian, and maintained that men without grace might doe all kinds of good works, even love God above all things, and that theſe works were true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for Juſtification. The <hi>Jacobins</hi> would have been very willing that there had been no mention made of that Merit <hi>de congruo,</hi> becauſe St. <hi>Thomas</hi> grew out of conceit with it, eſpecially in his old age.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they came to diſpute of thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are wrought in the hearts of men by the firſt inſpirations of preventing grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the infuſion of habitual Righteouſneſs. <hi>Luther</hi> was accuſed of ſaying that all theſe motions, ſuch as the fear of Puniſhment, and an abhorrence of ſin, were real ſins; that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was condemned as heretical, becauſe they had agreed that thoſe firſt motions of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are good works. The <hi>Carmelite Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Marinier</hi> maintained that this was but a diſpute about words, ſaying that theſe actions done out of the ſtate of grace were like Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs betwixt heat and cold: that they were in a mean betwixt actions done without grace which are real ſins, and thoſe which are performed in the ſtate of grace which are truly good. And that ſo as Lukewarmneſs is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99003:108"/>but a leſs cold, theſe fears of Puniſhments which precede converſion are a leſſer kind of ſins; but he was fain to recant his opinion, becauſe all the Divines were againſt him.</p>

                  <p>The Divines then deſcended to the queſtion of imputed Righteouſneſs; they all agreed, that Jeſus Chriſt hath merited for us, and that his merit is imputed to us. <hi>Albertus Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius,</hi> in giving his opinion, beſides inherent Righteouſneſs had expreſly aſſerted that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, which is made in favour of a juſtified man. <hi>Andreas de Vega</hi> was for retaining the word as very proper, though it be not to be found in Scripture, and to back his opinion produced
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99003:109"/>the teſtimony of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who had uſed it in his hundred and ninth Epiſtle. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico à Soto</hi> maintained that it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, becauſe neither the Fathers nor the Scriptures have ever uſed it; and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Lutherans</hi> abuſed it, affirming that that imputed Righteouſneſs is the ſole Juſtification of man; he added that it cut off all neceſſity of ſatisfaction, and equalled the meaneſt of all Saints to the bleſſed Virgin. This diſpute was managed ſo ſharply, and there was ſo much affectation in condemning a term that was acknowledged to be innocent, that it ſhew'd by what Spirit the Council was acted, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded all men that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were in all points to be made Hereticks at what rate ſoever.</p>
                  <p>There was no end of debating; for the Monks who are naturally wranglers furniſhed matter for them, and the Legates to gain time fomented the Diviſions. But for ſome time the diſputes were interrupted by the March of Souldiers, and the Jubile, that was publiſhed and celebrated for obtaining a happy ſucceſs in the War againſt the Hereticks. At length the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> being half ſpent, and the Council being at liberty and in a condition of acting; matters muſt needs be brought upon the ſtage again; the Subject of Juſtification had been ſufficiently canvaſſed; and now it was time to form Decrees, and to hold a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but it was neither the intention of the Pope nor of the Emperour that affairs ſhould proceed with ſo much expedition. The Pope ſought an opportunity of breaking up the Council, and the Emperour would have had the matter of Reformation firſt handled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99003:109"/>they condemned the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the higheſt importance, as that of Juſtification was. Wherefore it was neceſſary to gain time, though it was difficult to make any pretext for delay. However the Cardinal of <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> who was more skilled in the jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of School-Divinity than this Collegues, underttook the buſineſs, and engaged to revive all the diſputes, and to make them laſt as long as they pleaſed. In the Congregation of the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it was reſolved that ſome ſhould be employed to compoſe the Decrees upon the matters that had been debated; for this end were named three Biſhops, three Generals of Orders, and the Cardinal of <hi>Santa Croce</hi> to preſide in this little Cabal. The Cardinal made a Project of Deciſions and Canons very pat for reviving the former Debates, which miſſed not of its effect: for when the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who had compoſed the Canons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees propoſed them in the Congregations, all the Subjects that had been diſcourſed of before were reviewed; as Grace, the certainty that one may have that he is in the ſtate of Grace, Works performed out of the ſtate of grace, and in grace, imputed Righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Debate about the certainty that one may have that he is in the ſtate of Grace, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> and the <hi>Carmelite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinier</hi> defend the opinion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Congruity. The Cardinal all the while encouraged the Divines to the diſpute, telling them that they were weighty matters, and could not be too well examined.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place <hi>Andreas the Vega,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico à Soto</hi> grapled with <hi>Ambroſio Catarino</hi> and <hi>Marinier</hi> the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> about the certainty that one may have that he is in the ſtate of Grace. They who held that man cannot be aſſured of Juſtification, maintained their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99003:110"/>by all the Reaſons and Arguments, that are at this day uſed againſt the Proteſtants. <hi>Ambroſio Catarino</hi> and <hi>Marinier</hi> alledged on the contrary all the Arguments that are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent employed by the reformed Divines. And becauſe they were much urged with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Fathers, who ſeem to aſſert that one cannot be ſure of his Juſtification, they oppoſed paſſage to paſſage, and concluded that the Fathers had ſpoken variouſly upon that ſubject, according to the different views and apprehenſions that they had of it, and that therefore without conſulting them, the onely recourſe muſt be had to be holy Scriptures. Theſe reaſons wrought ſome effect, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the others not to call that certainty, that one is in the ſtate of grace, any more, a raſh Preſumption. <hi>Andreas de Vega</hi> went farther, he acknowledged that one might have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental certainty of his own Righteouſneſs that baniſhes all doubting: as when one is hot, ſaid he, he knows it certainly, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſenſe: but he would not have that aſſurance called a certainty of Faith; which the reſt called a moral Faith. <hi>Catarino,</hi> for his part, would have that aſſurance called a certainty of Faith; but would not, however, affirm that it was an act of Catholick and univerſal Faith; but of a particular Faith: ſo that he owned that it was not the ſame faith as that whereby one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Articles of the Creed, and the truths of Religion. All the <hi>Carmelites</hi> were on <hi>Catari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s ſide, becauſe of <hi>John Bacon</hi> a Monk of their order, who had been of that opinion. However, thoſe very men who were of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi>'s Judgment, thought that he expreſſed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99003:110"/>himſelf a little too hard, and ſtrained the point too far. The Biſhops and Divines came to ſuch heats in that Diſpute, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>di Santa Croce</hi> had no more need of adding fewel, but rather of quenching the fire,<note place="margin">They enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter of free will, and ſix Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles on that Subject, are drawn out of the Books of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi>

<list>
                        <item>1. That God is the cauſe of all actions good and bad, and that he operated in the treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as in the Converſion of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The two firſt propoſitions were not confuted by reaſons but by invectives; they were called mad, monſtrous, impious and blaſphemous opinions. The <hi>Carmelite Marinier</hi> who liked not that violent way, was for interpreting thoſe Articles in ſome good ſenſe, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that which affirms our actions to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not free. He obſerved that it was not true that all our actions are in our own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that the School-men themſelves are obliged to except the firſt motives which men cannot reſtrain. <hi>Andreas de Vega</hi> diſcourſed upon that matter in a very obſcure manner,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99003:111"/>and was hardly underſtood till he came to a Concluſion; wherein he ſaid, that there was no difference betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks as to the nature of free will in civil actions, and in the moral and external works of the Law, and that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did not ſtrip man of his free will, but in reſpect of ſupernatural works that prepared man for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which being conſonant to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Catholicks, he was of opinion that in this particular, ſomething ſhould be done for peace ſake. That name of peace was odious and grating; we are not met for that, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they, it is the buſineſs of Conferences to accommodate differences, but of Councils to condemn Hereſies: and indeed this Council was very far from indulging any thing to the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> this debate was the cauſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that aroſe betwixt the two Schools of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> that is to ſay, betwixt the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> and <hi>Jacobins,</hi> to wit, if it be in the Power of man to believe or not to believe. The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> maintained the opinion of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that it is not in the liberty of man not to believe, becauſe the underſtanding is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined by its object: when a truth is preſented to it, it cannot but ſee it, and when it perceives it, it cannot refuſe to cloſe with the ſame. But the <hi>Jacobins</hi> on the contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the opinion of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſaid that faith was a free action that might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned or hindered by the will. Concerning the third article wherein the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, that man's free will is loſt ſince that fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Champions for the pure Doctrine of Grace produced many Arguments and Authorities,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99003:111"/>and particularly they cited ſeveral paſſages of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wherein he ſays, <hi>Adam perdidit ſe &amp; liberum arbitrium.</hi> But to that <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> made anſwer, that the word <hi>free</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times oppoſed to neceſſity, and ſometimes to ſlavery: that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> took it in the firſt ſenſe, when they ſay that man hath loſt his free will, becauſe they would thereby ſignifie, that man acts by an inevitable neceſſity. But that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had taken the word <hi>free</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe as it is oppoſite to ſlavery, and that his meaning was, that man had loſt his free will, becauſe that free will is captivated under the bondage of ſin; though the laſt is abſolutely the ſenſe of the Proteſtants, as well as of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> This explication of <hi>Dominico â Soto</hi> was not well reliſhed, they would not have the free will to be a ſlave, neither to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity according to the ſenſe that was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> nor to ſin according to the ſenſe of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The Council could not endure that the free will ſhould be made a ſlave upon any account whatſoever; for had they owned with <hi>Soto,</hi> that it is under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin, they could not have condemned the title of <hi>Luther</hi>'s book <hi>de ſervo arbitrio,</hi> as they deſigned to doe. The fourth Article which ſaith that man hath onely free will to doe evil, was reckoned ridiculous; and the Divines of the Council laid it down as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, that free will is a power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ones ſelf to one of two contraries, to good or to evil. There were ſome, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that were not ſo paſſionate, who told them that their Maxime was not unexceptionable, and that God was free without having the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of determining himſelf to evil.</p>

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99003:112"/>There aroſe great Debates in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fifth and ſixth articles concerning the manner how free will concurs with grace in the work of converſion. The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Theology and Principles of their Maſter <hi>Scotus,</hi> maintained that the will which can prepare it ſelf for grace, can by much ſtronger reaſon admit or reject grace when it is offered. But the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> who are <hi>Thomiſts</hi> attributed to grace, the firſt motions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.<note place="margin">The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> are divided, the beginning of the new <hi>Thomiſts.</hi> Theſe laſt maintain that Grace is effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of it ſelf.</note> Here the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> were divided; for <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> acknowledged pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace, but he ſaid that it was in the power of man to accept or reject that grace; ſo that he made the efficacy of grace to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the will of man, and on the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that will, and denied grace of it ſelf to be efficacious. In this particular all the difference that was betwixt <hi>Soto,</hi> and the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers</hi> or <hi>Scotiſts</hi> was about the preparations: for the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> pretended that the will goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace by immediate preparations, which proceed from the will it ſelf; And <hi>Soto</hi> denied theſe immediate preparations, and onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted certain remote preparations of the will for the reception of grace. <hi>Luigi di Catanea</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> and <hi>Thomiſt,</hi> ſaid that according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the will may indeed reject ſufficient grace, but not effectual grace; becauſe this grace gets always the victory over the will. In this manner he laid down as a ground in Divinity, that the difference betwixt effectual grace, and ſufficient grace proceeds onely from the operation of God, and not from the conſent of the will; that is, he affirmed grace to be effectual of it ſelf. This is that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99003:112"/>
                     <hi>Luigi di Catanea</hi> who may be called the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of the new <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> who have made themſelves very conſiderable ſince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> in undertaking the defence of the Doctrine of St. <hi>Austin</hi> concerning Grace, which the School of <hi>Scotus</hi> that was <hi>Semipela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> had almoſt ſtifled. <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt <hi>Luigi di Catanea,</hi> that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt grace efficacious and grace ſufficient proceeds from the will, and that the conſent and determination of the will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone makes that which was onely ſufficient, to become effectual grace; this laſt opinion carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with applauſe in the Council; but by no other force than that of prejudice. For it could not be denied but that <hi>Soto</hi> ſpoke in an ambiguous and obſcure manner, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to rely too much upon what he ſaid, that he made a running kind of a fight on't, and ſeemed diffident of his own <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> On the contrary <hi>Catanea</hi> propoſed his Arguments with confidence and aſſurance, giving them a Character of evidence that confounded all his hearers. He boldly ſaid that he could not ſee how the opinion of <hi>Soto</hi> could be excuſed of <hi>Pelagianiſm:</hi> that to avoid the extremity wherein <hi>Luther</hi> had precipitated himſelf, he run upon another, that was every way as dangerous. Above all, he laid great ſtreſs on this, that the Doctrine of <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned free Predeſtination, and eſtabliſhed Predeſtination by the preſcience of works; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the efficacy of Grace depend on the Will of man, it is that Will which puts the difference betwixt the elect and the reprobate; a Sentiment confuted by all Divines. In effect,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99003:113"/>the Theology of <hi>Scotus</hi> is no conſequential Theology, whoſe principles ſupport one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and are well linked together: for on the one hand it defends free election and abſolute reprobation, and on the other, it oppugns the efficacy of grace of it ſelf, and maintains that the will may prepare it ſelf for Juſtification by its now ſtrength. Now they who have but a ſmattering in Divinity may eaſily ſee, that theſe two principles deſtroy one another; for if men diſtinguiſh themſelves one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, onely by accepting through the ſole Power of their own free Will, Grace ſufficient, which others do reject, it is clear that God muſt from Eternity have elected thoſe whom he foreſaw would ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from others by the acceptation of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grace.<note place="margin">They enter into the matter of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finding nothing to be cenſured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they condemn ſeven Propoſitions of the <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                     </note> This laſt conſideration of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>'s obliged the Fathers of the Council to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the matter of Predeſtination.

                  <p>Moſt part of the Divines thought, that the firſt propoſition was very ſound and catholick, to wit, that in predeſtination and reprobation, the will of God alone does all: that is to ſay, they approved abſolute and gratuitous prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, and they pretended that it was not onely conſonant to the judgment of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> but alſo to that of <hi>Scotus.</hi> This opinion was backt by a great number of authorities taken from holy Scripture, and the Fathers, particularly St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who in his old age had vigorouſly maintained this abſolute and free predeſtination: yet the election by fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of works found its Champions. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Bitonto</hi> and <hi>Salpi</hi> put themſelves at the head of the Monks, and made a Party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt free and abſolute predeſtination. They ſaid that God reſolved to give all men ſufficient Grace, and that in the fore-knowledge of God, election and reprobation depended on the good or bad uſe of that ſufficient Grace, becauſe God elected thoſe whom he had fore-known would conſent to and accept of that Grace, and reprobated thoſe that would reject it, they added that the contrary opinion was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and inhumane, that it made God unjuſt and an accepter of perſons, and ſuppoſed him to make his choice without any reaſon, but out of mere fancy. When they fought with the Arms of reaſon, they triumphed; but ſunk under the weight of the Authorities of Scripture and Fathers.</p>

As for inſtance thoſe of the ninth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that God loved <hi>Jacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before either of them had done good or evil: that of one lump he makes ſome Veſſels of honour and others of diſhonour; that it is neither of him that runneth, nor of him that willeth, but God that giveth the Bleſſing. But he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that beſides that abſolute predeſtination without fore-knowledge of works, there is another wherein God had decreed to ſave all thoſe that ſhould be converted; and that for that end he had given all men ſufficient Grace, to which ſome ſubmit, and others do reſiſt: and that this laſt election was uncertain, unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, conditional, and dependant on the will and works of man; he confeſſed that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was contrary to that of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> but he alſo ſaid, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s was contrary to the opinion of all others.</p>

This diſtinction raiſed more miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the Prelates, who were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Philoſophers nor Divines, than it brought light to the queſtion. The other ſix propoſitions were condemned by unanimous conſent; particularly that which aſſerted the perſeverance of true Saints, and the inamiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of righteouſneſs. They alledged the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Saul, Solomon, Judas,</hi> and others who had totally fallen from the real righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith they had been inveſted.</p>

But they were in great perplexity how to doe that; every Party ſtriving to have the Decrees worded in termes that might favour their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. <hi>Giacomo Cocco,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Corfu,</hi> was of the mind that no opinion which could be interpreted in a ſound ſenſe, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99003:115"/>and therefore he deſired that all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary exceptions and limitations ſhould be put in the Canons for removing all Ambiguity. Others oppoſed that, ſaying that if all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations muſt be inſerted, it would render the Canons long, tedious and intricate. But the Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia</hi> propoſed a method which was approved, and followed during the remaining time of the Council. He ſaid that there ought to be made in the firſt place a Decree of Doctrine, which ſhould be divided into Chapters; that therein the Doctrine of the Church ſhould be declared in a Style and Method capable to give content to all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: and that then another Decree ought to be made containing nothing but the Canons and <hi>Anathema</hi>'s againſt Hereticks. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Cardinal <hi>Santa Croce</hi> applied all his Pains and Skill in the compoſing of theſe Decrees; and laboured in it with ſo much ſucceſs that he gave content to all; becauſe he worded them with ſo much Ambiguity, that every Party found their opinions therein. But this was not done without trouble; for there were above an hundred Congregations as well of Divines as Prelates held about it, and from the beginning of <hi>September</hi> untill the end of <hi>November,</hi> there paſt not a day wherein the Cardinal did not peruſe his Decrees, and alter ſomething in them. In a word, they found a means to ſatisfie the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and the <hi>Thomiſts, Catarino</hi> and his adherents, who ſtood for the certainty that one may have of his own juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and thoſe that oppoſed it. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees were ſo artificially contrived to pleaſe all, that <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> immediately after wrote
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99003:115"/>three Books, <hi>de natura &amp; gratia,</hi> and found all his opinions in the deciſions of the Council. And nevertheleſs <hi>Andreas de Vega</hi> a famous <hi>Cordelier,</hi> on the other hand compoſed fifteen large Books upon the ſame Subject, and found all his opinions in the ſame Decrees, though they were quite oppoſite to the ſentiments of <hi>Soto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe matters of Doctrine were in agitation, Congregations were alſo held about Reformation. The firſt thing then that was propoſed, was the ſetling of ſome good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that none might enter into Epiſcopal Sees, but ſuch as were capable to govern and edifie the Church. But the Council deſpaired of finding remedies proper for the evil; becauſe Canonical Elections were aboliſhed, and in moſt places the nomination to Biſhopricks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed either to Kings or to the Pope. They conſidered very well that it was to no purpoſe to make Canons; for it would be impoſſible to make thoſe Perſons ever ſubmit to them. So the Council paſt by that conſultation, and proceeded to the point of Reſidence as well of Biſhops as of Curates and other Beneficiaries. Horrid was the corruption that prevailed in this particular. The Biſhops knew not what it was to reſide; nay, and if a Living was but ſufficient to maintain the Curate and his Vicar, he abandoned the care of his Flock, and lived where he had a mind. From the time of St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> there had been a cuſtome of ordaining Prieſts without a Title, who were not confined to any place, nor obliged to Reſidence: St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> himſelf was one of theſe Prieſts; he was a Prieſt of <hi>Antioch</hi> where he never reſided,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99003:116"/>and ſo was <hi>Ruffinus</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Aquileia.</hi> But however, theſe Prieſts without Churches had no Profits nor Revenues. The cuſtome of bearing the Titles and receiving the Profits of Benefices without any Service, began in the Latin Church about the ſeventh Century; for then began Princes to reward their Servants with Preſentations to vacant Benefices. And by degrees was introduced the diſtinction of Benefices of Reſidence, and Sine-cures or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices of Non-reſidence, under pretence that there were Benefices in which one was not obliged to reſide. The Canoniſts eſtabliſhed this maxim, <hi>that every Benefice is given for Office:</hi> that is to ſay, that a Beneficiary is preciſely obliged to no more but to ſay his Breviary, for enjoying his Benefice with a good Conſcience. The Popes had often thundered againſt the Non-reſidence of Biſhops and other Paſtours that had the cure of Souls; but they medled not with Benefices that were called Sine-cures, becauſe they were glad that all Church-men might not reſide, that ſo their Courts might be more numerous and glorious. This was ſuch an overſpreading and ſo great a corruption, that all were fain to own it. But the Biſhops to extenuate their fault alledged that no man was obliged to Reſidence but by the order of the Pope, and not the command of God. This gave occaſion to the ſtarting of a controverſie, whether Reſidence be of Divine right and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or onely Humane and Papal; and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> was on their ſide, who thought it to be of Divine right. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Reſidence, that was propoſed by the Legates and backt by the Biſhops, brought this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99003:116"/>queſtion upon the ſtage, Whether it was of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Humane right. We ſhall find in the ſequel what terrible debates this occaſioned in the Council; though the firſt time that the queſtion was propoſed, the heat of diſpute was but moderate.</p>
                  <p>The Legates thought it enough to propoſe means to oblige Paſtours to Reſidence: but the Monks and eſpecially the <hi>Jacobins</hi> to tie the knot of this obligation a little faſter, averred that Reſidence was neceſſary by Divine right. Two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monks, <hi>Bartholomè de Carranza</hi> who was afterward Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> and <hi>Dominico â Soto</hi> reaſoned ſtrongly for that. The Canoniſts and <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion that the neceſſity of Reſidence was onely of Humane right. <hi>Ambroſio Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> though a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> was of the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſaid that there was but onely one Epiſcopate eſtabliſhed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is that of the Pope; that all other Biſhops holding their Authority of him, were no more obliged to Reſidence, but according as he was pleaſed to enjoyn them. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops not onely publickly favoured Reſidence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, but privately encouraged the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins</hi> to maintain it ſtoutly. In this they had ſecret and myſterious deſigns, which they did not communicate to any; they aimed at the reſtauration of the Authority of the Biſhops, which was born down and oppreſſed by the Pope; for it once it had been decided that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops hold their Authority from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that they are obliged to reſide in the midſt of their Flocks, to take the care of them, not by the command of the Pope, but by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99003:117"/>of God, they perſwaded themſelves that they might eaſily provide againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſed upon the Ordinaries; which ſhall be ſet forth more at large in the ſequel, when we ſhall have a new occaſion to ſpeak of this queſtion, which was bandied with much more fierceneſs, in the third convocation of the Council under <hi>Pius</hi> IV. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were cunning enough in diſguiſing the true reaſons of their Conduct, the Legates were not behind hand in diving into their intentions: and therefore they dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly waved that queſtion by referring it to another Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of the matter of Reformation, they entred upon the examination of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions which were granted by the Pope to the prejudice of Ordinaries. In the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church all that is comprehended within the precincts of a Dioceſs, whether Monaſteries, Churches, or Benefices, is ſubject to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Biſhop of the Dioceſs. But in the Latin Church it is not ſo: in the firſt place rich and powerfull Abbots, to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the juriſdiction of the Biſhops, to whom they gave Umbrage, and with whom they often quarelled, obtained of the Popes to be taken under the Protection of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to hold immediately from the holy See. The Popes found that that hit very pat with their intereſts; becauſe thereby they acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Subjects in all places, and that he who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains privileges, is obliged to maintain the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of him that grants them: and therefore they were very liberal in their Exemptions. They thereupon took from under the juriſdiction
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99003:117"/>of Biſhops thoſe great Societies of <hi>Clugny</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaux;</hi> they granted the ſame privileges to the Chapters of Cathedral Churches, and at length all the Orders of the mendicant Friars in their firſt inſtitution obtained the ſame privileges of holding immediately from the holy See. The Biſhops could not but grumble at theſe Exemptions that deprived them of ſo many ſubjects; And they would have taken it extremely well it <hi>Giacomo Corteſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vaiſon,</hi> had demanded the abolition of them. This affair having been referred to another Seſſion, was brought in again with the caſe of Reſidence; but hardly any thing could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning theſe two Articles. As to the firſt which is the caſe of Reſidence, it was concluded, that the ancient Canons which command Reſidence under ſuch and ſuch Pains, ſhould be reinforced with new Penalties. It was therefore decreed that a Biſhop who ſhould for ſix Months together be abſent from his Dioceſs ſhould loſe a fourth part of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals: that if his abſence continued a Year, he ſhould forfeit the half of his Revenue; and that if he perſiſted in that fault he ſhould by the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> be complained of to the Pope, to the end that the holy See might take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance thereof, and either puniſh that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Paſtour, or put another in his place; that if the non-reſident Prelate were a <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,</hi> he ſhould be complained of to the Pope by the Eldeſt of his Suffragans. As for infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Paſtours, it was ordered that they might be by the Biſhops compelled to Reſidence, and if among the non-reſident Curates any one might happen to have an Exemption from the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99003:118"/>Pope, he might nevertheleſs be forced to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence by the Biſhop, acting as the Delegate of the holy See.</p>
                  <p>As to the matter of Exemptions it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that no Monk being out of his Convent under pretext of the Privilege of his Order ſhould excuſe himſelf from being puniſhed and corrected by the Ordinary of the place, but in this alſo the Biſhop muſt act as Delegate of the holy See; it was likewiſe ordained that the Chapters of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches might not decline the Juriſdiction of the Biſhops as to the viſitation and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners. And laſt of all Biſhops were prohibited to perform any Epiſcopal function in the Dioceſs of another, without permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Matters being thus prepared, nothing could hinder the holding of the Seſſion, nor was the Pope himſelf of opinion that it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed any longer. On the contrary he was glad of that opportunity to nettle the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who inſtantly deſired that no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie ſhould be decided, till he had reduced the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to a Neceſſity of ſubmitting to the Council. The unions of Great men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other foundation but intereſt, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver firm, nor of long continuance. The Pope and the Emperour who had been ſo good friends in the beginning of the year, fell a claſhing one with another before it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And thereupon the Pope ordered that the Seſſion ſhould be held, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Emperour's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99003:119"/>found in the fifth Chapter <hi>cum neque homo ipſe nihil omnino agat;</hi> they ſaid it was little better than gibberiſh and nonſenſe, becauſe every propoſition wherein there are two Negatives, ought to be reſolved into an Affirmative; ſo that that propoſition ought to be reſolved into this <hi>cum etiam homo ipſe aliquid omnino agat,</hi> which is nonſenſe. But the Divines made more important remarks: they ſaid that the Doctrine of the Council, which affirms that man may reſiſt, even to the end, the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Ghoſt, does not at all agree with that ancient Prayer of the Church, <hi>Et ad te noſtras etiam rebelles compelle propitius vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntates.</hi> It was thought that the Council had a deſign to condemn effectual Grace which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſerted; that is to ſay, Grace effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in it ſelf: they alſo pickt out contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein; as for inſtance in that which is ſaid in the ſeventh Chapter, that Juſtice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a certain meaſure <hi>according to God's good will and pleaſure, and the diſpoſition of him that receives it;</hi> they could not comprehend how Grace was given at the ſame time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good will and pleaſure of God, and according to the diſpoſition of him that receives it; for if it be according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, it is without any reſpect to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and if God have any regard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, then it depends not abſolutely on his pleaſure. They found another contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that here the Council condemns thoſe who ſay that men are not able to fulfill the Commandments of God, and in the ſecond Seſſion had commanded men to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, <hi>quantum quiſque poterit,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:99003:119"/>as far as one is able; becauſe theſe terms ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that every one is not able to fulfill the Law of God. By theſe cenſures it was made apparent that in a matter purely Theological the Fathers of the Council had made uſe of many terms borrowed from Philoſophy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> they could not have made an Article of Faith. But above all other, there happened one unlucky hit to the Council, and made it evident that they had conceived their Deciſions with intent to pleaſe all men except the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> which was this. In the Book which <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> wrote <hi>de natura &amp; gratia,</hi> which we mentioned before, when he comes to treat of the certainty that one may have of his own Juſtification, he proved that the intention of the Council was to condemn the opinion which affirms, that one may have ſuch a certainty of his being in the State of Grace as excludes all doubting. <hi>Catarino</hi> that was preſent at the Council as well as <hi>Soto,</hi> publiſhed a Book wherein he aſſerted that the intention of the Council was not to condemn thoſe who ſay, that one may believe that he is in the State of Grace with as much certainty as one believes an Article of Faith. On the contrary that the Council favoured that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe it is expreſſed in the twenty ſixth Canon, that the righteous man ought to hope for a reward. <hi>Catarino</hi> concluded that a righteous man cannot expect his reward, unleſs he be aſſured of his Righteouſneſs. Theſe two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours wrote ſeveral Books againſt one another on this ſubject, and even complained to the Council, that Deciſions and Sentiments were
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99003:120"/>impoſed upon them, which they had not indeed intended. The Council was in perplexity and could not tell what to think of this controverſie; which made People laugh in their ſleeve: It was thought ſtrange that the Fathers ſhould not underſtand their own Deciſions, and that brought the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi>'s Sermon into mens minds, who in the opening of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil promiſed the Prelates that the holy Ghoſt would inſpire them as he did <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> who ſpoke a Prophecy which he underſtood not.</p>

But becauſe the point of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration carried along with it that of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council and the Pope, which the Legates would not meddle with, they wiſely laid it aſide, and favoured the Divines to whom that ſubject was not very agreeable neither, but for reaſons far different from thoſe of the Legates; for that is a point the Schoolmen do not much treat of, nor are well verſed in. So it was concluded that the matter of the Sacraments which depend on the miniſterial function ſhould be diſcuſſed, for the Chapter of Doctrine: and that they might jointly treat of Reformation, as had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, it was thought fit to endeavour the Reformation of abuſes that had crept into the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99003:120"/>Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>di Santa Croce</hi> had the Change of preſiding in the Congregations for Doctrine, and the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> undertook the Province of moderating in the Congregations of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts, for Reformation; beſides theſe, the matter of Reſidence was again brought upon the ſtage: the Biſhops, and particularly the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> preſſed to have it declared of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right. But the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> a brisk and ſubtile Protectour of the papal Power perceiving that that would make a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach in his Maſter's Authority, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged reaſons for having it deferred till another time; he told them that that Subject had been handled too eagerly, that they ought to ſuffer the Stirs of Paſſion to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make way for the Calm of Charity, that ſo the holy Ghoſt might breath upon them by his inſpirations: however he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded theſe devout Conſiderations with a plain and poſitive prohibition not to meddle with that ſubject for the preſent. This ſeemed a little hard, and ſomewhat inconſiſtent with the Liberty of the Council. Nevertheleſs they condeſcended to treat of the Cauſes which hindered Reſidence, the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of which is the Plurality of Benefices.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the Point of Doctrine, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts were made of the Books of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> that they might know their opinions as to the Sacraments in general, and in particular, as to Baptiſm and Confirmation. The Articles that were drawn out as to the Sacraments in general were in number fourteen, as to Baptiſm ſeventeen, and as to Confirmation four;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99003:121"/>wherein under the title of <hi>Lutheran</hi> errours, were comprehended all the opinions of the Anabaptiſts, which are rejected by true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. All theſe articles were examined in Congregations, and great Debates happened about ſome of them; they began firſt with the number of the Sacraments: The Divines agreed upon the number of ſeven, which had been firſt defined by the Maſter of the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then confirmed by a Deciſion of the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> in their inſtruction to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> But they were not of opinion that this number ſhould be determined to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs than ſeven, becauſe of the difficulty of defining a Sacrament, in regard that according to the different definitions that may be given of it, a thing may be or not be a Sacrament. There was ſome difficulty alſo ſtarted about the opinions of ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; of whom ſome had held our Saviour's waſhing the Apoſtles feet to be a Sacrament, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Others, as St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> had called all the Ceremonies of the Church Sacraments, and ſometimes had reſtrained the Name of Sacrament to Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; they therefore concluded, that they ought to retain the number of ſeven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not determine it by a Decree, nor ſecond that with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s. But others who were reſolved to ſhew no favour to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> maintained that the boldneſs of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks ought to be taken down, who aſſum'd the liberty to make ſometimes three Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſometimes four, and ſometimes more. And here it was that divers pretty reaſons were ſtarted for proving the number of ſeven
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99003:121"/>Sacraments, ſome taken from the ſeven Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal vertues, others from the ſeven Deadly ſins, many from the ſeven Days of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſeven principal Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the ſeven Planets; though theſe reaſons of the Divines were diverting enough; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deduction of them was long, they were ſomewhat tedious to the Prelates. They likewiſe propoſed that the ſeven Sacraments ſhould be named, leſt ſome raſh Heretick keeping ſtill the number of ſeven, might ſtrike out one of the true, and clap a falſe one into the place; they reſolved in like manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that the Sacraments were inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt: but ſome were of opinion that it would be better not to decide that point, that they might ſpare the reputation of ſome Catholick Doctours who had maintained a different opinion: as the Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, who holds that St. <hi>James</hi> inſtituted Extreme Unction, <hi>Bonaventure</hi> and <hi>Alexander de Hale</hi> who maintain'd that Confirmation began after the time of the Apoſtles: nay and the ſame <hi>Bonaventure</hi> was of opinion that the Apoſtles had inſtituted the Sacrament of Penance.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Article of the abſtracts related to the neceſſity of the Sacraments, which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were accuſed of denying; ſome were of opinion that it ought not to be pronounced abſolutely and without reſerve that the Sacraments are neceſſary; becauſe ſome there are that may be let alone, nay and ſome that are inconſiſtent together, as Orders and Marriage. The <hi>Carmelite Marini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> reaſoned ſtrongly againſt the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99003:122"/>of the Sacraments; he proved that there could be no uſe of the diſtinction of <hi>Actus</hi> and <hi>Voto</hi> and <hi>Propoſito</hi> in the Point of the Neceſſity of the Sacraments for receiving of Grace; as if it were abſolutely neceſſary to receive the Sacraments at leaſt in purpoſe and intention, becauſe ſome have received Grace, even before they knew that there was any ſuch thing as a Sacrament: he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Example of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his whole Family, and of the Thief that was converted, who had all received the Holy Ghoſt before they knew that there was a Baptiſm: whence it is clear that they had neither received it actually nor in intention, and nevertheleſs they had received Grace. This ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was evaded by a diſtinction of a confuſed knowledge and a diſtinct knowledge; ſaying that theſe People had at leaſt a confuſed knowledge and implicite intention of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Sacrament. The third Article of theſe abſtracts related to the dignity of the Sacraments; becauſe this opinion was imputed to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> that all the Sacraments are equal in dignity. This being a matter of leſs importance, it took up but little time, and the propoſition that admits of an equality in the Sacraments was adjudged to be falſe, becauſe every Sacrament hath its particular Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the fourth Article which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the manner how the Sacraments ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they pretended that according to the opinion of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> they are but Emblemes, and at moſt but ſigns of the Grace which one has already received, and not means of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99003:122"/>receiving it. All unanimouſly condemned that errour, and concurred in Judgment, That the Sacraments are the Cauſes of Grace. But here aroſe a great Debate betwixt the Schools of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> that is to ſay, betwixt the <hi>Jacobins</hi> and the <hi>Cordeliers;</hi> the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> maintained that the Sacraments are phyſical and inſtrumental Cauſes of Grace: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> according to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> their chief Divines, ſaid that God produces not Grace which is ſpiritual by a thing that is corporeal, and that therefore all the Efficacy of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments depends on the Goſpel Covenant, whereby God has engaged himſelf to confer inward Grace, as often as the outward Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is adminiſtred; ſo that they maintained the Sacraments to be onely moral Cauſes. The <hi>Jacobins</hi> accuſed the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> of approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching near the opinion of the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> And the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> twitted the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> for aſſerting an abſurdity that gave the Hereticks advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the Church. And it was impoſſible to make them friends. The Legates complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Generals of the Orders, of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of their Religious, and even wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> that it was neceſſary to repreſs them.</p>
                  <p>There happened alſo another quarel betwixt the <hi>Jacobins</hi> and <hi>Cordeliers</hi> about the difference of the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon occaſion of the ſixth Article of the Abſtracts. That Article imported, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament had the virtue of conferring Grace: and this gave an opportunity of handling the queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99003:123"/>the Efficacy of the ancient Sacraments. The <hi>Jacobins</hi> maintained that thoſe of the Old Law did not juſtifie <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> but <hi>ex opere operantis,</hi> that is to ſay, in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that they did not juſtifie by virtue of the Ceremony, but according to the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart of thoſe that received them. <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> were of opinion that Circumciſion juſtified <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and to this the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> adhered; they proved it by the Infants who under the Law were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Circumciſion; if Circumciſion juſtified Infants, ſaid they, that could not be by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Faith, nor Charity, nor any other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, becauſe Infants could have no actual vertue. And becauſe St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had anſwered to that, that in thoſe days Infants were ſaved by the Faith of their Parents; the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> loaded that anſwer with this great abſurdity, that now-a-days the Condition of Chriſtians would be worſe than that of the Jews, ſeeing at preſent no Infant is ſaved in Baptiſm by the ſole Faith of its Parents.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, ſixth, ſeventh and eighth Articles were paſt over; the fifth becauſe it had been ſufficiently decided already in the preceding Seſſion; that Article ſet forth, that according to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> Faith alone without the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments confers Grace. And the Council in the foregoing Seſſion had defined that Faith alone does not juſtifie. The ſixth was laid aſide becauſe of the Debate we juſt now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, betwixt the <hi>Jacobins</hi> and <hi>Cordeliers</hi> about the Efficacy of the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament. The ſeventh and eighth, it was thought, might be taken in an Orthodox ſenſe,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99003:123"/>becauſe theſe Articles affirmed that Grace is not given to all who receive the Sacraments. But upon account of the ninth Article which denied, according to the Sentiment of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> that any Character was imprinted in the Sacraments, why they might not be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, there was ſome diſpute. <hi>Dominico à Soto</hi> would have had it defined, that that Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is founded on Scripture; others were of a contrary opinion, becauſe neither <hi>Gratian,</hi> nor the Maſter of the Sentences ſay any thing as to that, and that <hi>Scotus</hi> confeſſes that it can neither be maintained by Scripture nor the Fathers, but onely by the Authority of the Church: And it is to be obſerved that that is the manner of this Authour when he would ſmoothly condemn an opinion. It was decided againſt the tenth Article of the Doctrine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that it is falſe, That a wicked Miniſter cannot adminiſter a true Sacrament. Againſt the Eleventh, that it is falſe that all Chriſtians of what Sex or Condition ſoever may preach the word and adminiſter all the Sacraments. Againſt the Twelfth that it belongs not to all Paſtours to encreaſe or diminiſh the Ceremonies of the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A remarkable opinion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarino</hi> about the intention that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in him that adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>On occaſion of the thirteenth Article which regards the intention that is thought neceſſary for the Validity of a Sacrament, there aroſe great Debates. The Council of <hi>Florence</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it to be neceſſary; and that was a Knot not to be untied; but <hi>Ambroſio Catarino</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Minori</hi> ſtarted a very conſiderable opinion; he ſtrongly urged that the intention of the Prieſt could not be neceſſary, becauſe if ſo, the Salvation of Souls would depend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99003:124"/>on the will of a man, who might be ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to adminiſter the Sacraments without intention: he aggravated the inconveniences of that opinion by this argument, that if a Child baptiſed without intention ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Biſhop, he not being truly baptiſed all the Prieſts that he might ordain would not be Prieſts, and could not adminiſter true Sacraments, and that ſo many Millions of Souls would periſh by the Crime of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man. He therefore concluded that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which is neceſſary, is an external inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may be gathered from the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and is ſignified by viſible actions, which fully agrees with the opinion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; that overture was rejected, though the Council was ſtunned with the weight of his reaſons, no man being in a condition to make him an Anſwer. They decided againſt the fourteenth without any Diſpute, that it is falſe, That the Sacraments have onely been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the quickning of Faith.</p>
                  <p>There happened much leſs Diſpute about the ſeventeen Articles of Baptiſm; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Debate it was defined. 1. That in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church there is true Baptiſm; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the third place that Baptiſm admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by Hereticks is true Baptiſm; and ſo of all the other propoſitions that were attributed to the Proteſtants, which were condemned with great Unanimity. The laſt of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles about Confirmation, which related to the manner of adminiſtring it, occaſioned a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what greater Noiſe. The Divines would have the Biſhop onely to be the Miniſter of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99003:124"/>but the action of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great puzled them. This Pope permitted a ſimple Prieſt to confirm; But the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> and all the School of <hi>Scotus,</hi> who attribute this Power onely to the Biſhop, alledged that that had never been but once permitted by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and that perhaps that action was no true Sacrament. <hi>Thomas</hi> did indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that properly the Biſhop is the Miniſter of Confirmation; but he ſaid that a Prieſt might adminiſter it by a permiſſion from the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe matters were canvaſſing in the Congregation for Doctrine, in the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided they treated about the means of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the abuſes which had crept into the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments; and it was ordained.
<list>
                        <item>1. That the Sacraments of the Church ſhould be conferred <hi>gratis,</hi> and no man allowed to take any Profit, Alms, or voluntary Gift upon any pretext whatſoever.</item>
                        <item>2. That the Sacrament of Baptiſm ſhould not be adminiſtred but in Churches, and that in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches where there are baptiſmal Fonts and Chapels, except in Caſes of Neceſſity, and when the Children of Great Princes were to be baptiſed.</item>
                        <item>3. That no excommunicate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be admitted to be a Godfather, nor any other under the age of fourteen, and that they ſhould not admit but of one God-father; beſides that, there were ſome Orders made for regulating the Decency of Baptiſm, but they are not very important.</item>
                     </list> There was not ſo much jangling amongſt the Canoniſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reformation, as had been among the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99003:125"/>concerning the matter of Doctrine; and yet they had much adoe to agree about the gratuitous way of adminiſtring the Sacraments. The rigider ſort would not have had it allowed to the Church-men to accept of any Preſent, Alms or voluntary Offering, under pretence of any contrary Cuſtome, and preſſed hard theſe words of the Goſpel, <hi>freely have ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give:</hi> they added many Canons denouncing <hi>Anathema</hi>'s out of the ancient Councils, againſt that kind of Simony. The Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> who otherways was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous for Reformation powerfully backt that Party: But others more remiſs maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that voluntary Offerings might be taken; they produced for themſelves a Canon of the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which allows the taking of what is offered by him that brings a Child to be baptiſed; above all they defended their Cauſe by the ſixty ſixth Chapter of the fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> held under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, which permits it as a laudable Cuſtome to give Offerings at the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. The Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that that ſixty ſixth Chapter of the fourth Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> ought to be underſtood of Offerings that have been always ſetled in the Church, as Tithes, firſt Fruits and Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings that are made at the Altar; and becauſe they could not agree upon the matter, they referred it to a general Congregation, but the ſame difficulties hindred the Concluſion of that Point there alſo.</p>
                  <p>In the general Congregation they had much adoe to agree about the form of the Decrees concerning the Doctrine of the Sacraments.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99003:125"/>At length they framed fourteen Canons with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s concerning the Doctrine of the Sacraments in general, ten about that of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and three concerning that of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Divines deſired that beſides the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s Chapters might be drawn up, as had been done in the point of Juſtification, for publiſhing and declaring the Doctrine of the Church. But they found it to be a very difficult matter, by reaſon of the diverſity of opinions. They could not be ſo fortunate in this as they had been in the preceding Seſſion, when they found Ambiguous Terms that gave content to all; for on the preſent Subject they could not hit upon Terms which did not croſs either one ſide or other; and that they had no mind to do, being willing to pleaſe all Parties. So that the Council reſolved to reſt ſatisfied with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s; and that opinion prevailed the rather, becauſe the contrary was very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly oppoſed by <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Cigale</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Albinga,</hi> who told them that <hi>never any man had forſaken his opinion becauſe it had been condemned, and that though all Catholicks do profeſs that they will refer themſelves to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, nevertheleſs they do not do ſo; but more obſtinately defend their opinion, when once it is condemned.</hi> The Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſaid he, that the Doctors make of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the judgment of the Church, are but Complements and terms of Civility, which are not ſo to be abuſed, as to be taken literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they are to be anſwered by a civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and charitable deportment. Every one was convinced of the truth of this in their own Conſciences, and therefore they yielded
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99003:126"/>to that reaſon. So that there was no deciſion made touching the queſtions in controverſie amongſt the Catholicks themſelves, that they might not condemn any, nor give occaſion to a ſpirit of Defection. The Legates acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pope with all theſe difficulties, and whilſt they expected an anſwer, they fell to treat of other matters. In the Congregation of the twenty fifth of <hi>January</hi> the buſineſs of Reformation was propoſed, they came to ſpeak of the remiſneſs of Biſhops in the diſcharge of their Duties; and the Legates who were not vexed to ſee the blame laid at the Biſhops doors, and that they were look'd upon as the cauſe of all the diſorders, oppoſed nothing that was moved upon that Subject; ſo the Prelates ſported themſelves with an imaginary liberty in declaming againſt themſelves. <hi>Giovanni Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lanciano</hi> was not ſo patiently heard; becauſe he attributed the ſource of all the evils to the abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> however he was ſuffered to ſpeak. But <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Muis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> that ſpoke next, refuted him, and made it appear that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders proceeded from Kings who had the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to Biſhopricks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The abuſe of the Plurality of Benefices, and its vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſources.</note>From this they went on to that thorny mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about Plurality of Benefices which was a hinderance to Reſidence; becauſe a Prelate who had two Biſhopricks could not be in two places. This Plurality of Benefices was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced three manner of ways. Firſt, under pretext that one Benefice alone was not enough for the maintainance of a Miniſter at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, more were given him, and Benefices were diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Compatible</hi> and <hi>Incompatible.</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:99003:126"/>The <hi>Compatible</hi> are ſuch as do not oblige to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, and have not the cure of Souls; the <hi>Incompatible</hi> are thoſe that bind to Reſidence. Though in the beginning they might make ſome ſcruple of annexing <hi>Incompatible</hi> Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet they made none in joyning thoſe that were called <hi>Compatible.</hi> Now the ſufficiency of a Benefice was reckoned according to the quality of the <hi>Incumbent;</hi> for as a Gentleman or a Lord could not ſubſiſt at ſo eaſie a rate as an ordinary man, ſo they allotted him more <hi>Compatible</hi> Benefices according to the Character he bore of Abbot, Biſhop or Cardinal. The ſecond cauſe of the multiplication of Benefices are <hi>Commendums.</hi> Heretofore when a Benefice was vacant, and for ſome reaſon, as of Plague or War, it was not poſſible to proceed ſo ſoon to the Election of a Succeſſour, he that had the right of Patronage recommended the care of the Benefice to ſome Perſon with whoſe prudence he was well ſatisfied; during the time of the vacancy this <hi>Commendatary</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Fruits, and was accountable for them. But in progreſs of time, it came to paſs that under divers pretexts the <hi>Commendataries</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Revenues of the Benefice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded as much as lay in their power the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him who ought to poſſeſs the Benefice in Title. To put a ſtop to theſe diſorders, it was ordained that theſe <hi>Commendums</hi> ſhould not continue above ſix Months. But the Popes began quickly to grant them for much longer time, and at length granted them for Life, giving liberty to the <hi>Commendataries</hi> to enjoy the Profits during Life. By this means a man could enjoy but one Benefice in Title, but he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99003:127"/>might poſſeſs ſeveral in <hi>Commendum:</hi> and even Biſhopricks and ſmaller Cures were thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. This was a very great abuſe, at which the Adherents of <hi>Luther</hi> complained much; but the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo far from being aſhamed of this abuſe, that they ſhew'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious inſtance of it, at the very ſame time when the <hi>Lutherans</hi> moſt fiercely declamed againſt the corruptions of the Church, and that was in the year 1534. when <hi>Clement</hi> VII. gave all the Benefices in Chriſtendom in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum</hi> to his Nephew <hi>Hippolito de Medicis</hi> for ſix Months, to count from the day that he took poſſeſſion of them, with Power to take up all the Rents, and to apply them to his proper uſe. In a word, the laſt way of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Canons which prohibited Plurality of Benefices, was the Annexing of Benefices. The Pope was wont to caſt together forty or fifty Benefices, and though they were in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdoms, yet that was reckoned but the enjoying of one Benefice according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, becauſe of many Benefices they had made but one. But leſt this Union of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices might in progreſs of time leſſen the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Livings, it was appointed to laſt no longer than the Life of the Incumbent, in whoſe favour it had been granted; and that by his Death the Benefices ſhould be reputed <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſunited. There was a neceſſity of aboliſhing theſe three abuſes for hindring the Plurality of Benefices: and the Prelates as to that, gave their opinions with a great deal of liberty. They ſpared not the Cardinals who poſſeſſed ſeveral Biſhopricks, nor the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> that by Diſpenſations favoured that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99003:127"/>The Legates who feared that the matter might be puſht on too far, ſeconded the overture that was made by the Biſhop of <hi>Albinga,</hi> of referring it to the Pope. They ſaid that it was a matter that principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it would be a diſgrace to the Pope to be thought incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Reforming his own Court. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates wrote immediately to <hi>Rome</hi> about it, and the Pope gladly received the propoſition. He removed to <hi>Rome</hi> the whole affair of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by a Bull; but the Legates durſt not ſhew it, becauſe it was too ample, the Pope therein taking too much Authority to himſelf, and becauſe the Biſhops alſo who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to conſent to that Reference, oppoſed it. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops were ſo far from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of referring the matter to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly beſtir themſelves for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs.</note> that they themſelves undertook to give a model of that Reformation. They drew up a cenſure in writing, which contained eleven Articles for a very ſtrict Reformation; as for regulating the exactneſs that ought to be had in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops and Curates when they were to be preferred to Churches, for obliging Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Biſhops to reſide at leaſt ſix Months in their Biſhopricks, for declaring Reſidence to be of Divine right, for preventing that into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable abuſe that one man ſhould enjoy ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cathedral Churches, for obliging the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals themſelves to reſign all they had but one, which they might enjoy, for prohibiting thoſe Unions of Benefices for Life, for reſcinding and annulling all Diſpenſations obtained or to be obtained from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> without lawfull cauſe, and for giving the Ordinaries
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99003:128"/>power of judging the Validity of the cauſe for which the Diſpenſation had been obtained. This was ſigned by twenty Biſhops, and by Cardinal <hi>Pacieco.</hi> The attempt ſurprized the Legates, becauſe of the boldneſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and that the Biſhops had adventured to aſſemble themſelves without their permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Theſe Articles were ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and at the ſame time the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> wrote that it was his advice, that that Enterprize ought to be withſtood without the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion; adding withall that it would be convenient to make ſome Reformation at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſtop the Mouth of the Council. But above all things the Legates urged, that the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Biſhops who were retired to keep <hi>Lent</hi> at home in their own Churches, ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be ſent back to <hi>Trent.</hi> The Pope followed that advice, and gave order to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> to oblige the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops who paſſed by <hi>Venice,</hi> or who were there ſtill, to return with all ſpeed to <hi>Trent,</hi> that they might make head againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> At the ſame time he called a Congregation of the Deputies at <hi>Rome</hi> for examining the Writing.

                     </note>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made great reflexions upon that attempt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Pope began to dread a Combination betwixt them and the <hi>Germans;</hi> ſo that not thinking his Authority ſafe enough in the Zeal of the Legates, and the Recruit of the <hi>Italians</hi> whom he had ſent to the Council, he reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Council unto a Town where he might neither ſtand in awe of the Emperour, nor of the Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe caſt his eyes upon the City of <hi>Bologna.</hi> But he was not willing to do it of himſelf; but thought it more proper to have it done by his Legates; to the end that if the matter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, all the diſgrace might fall upon them, and that he himſelf might onely divide with them the trouble of the diſappointment; for that end he ſent them a Bull, bearing date the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> 1547. but which was very well known to have been made two years before; by that Bull he gave them full power to remove the Council whitherſoever they ſhould think fit, but at the ſame time ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that they ſhould not mention the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the enſuing Seſſion were over. Whilſt theſe reſolutions were on foot at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> plaid his part: he ſounded the tempers, gained ſome by promiſes, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99003:129"/>drew others over by divers ways, that ſo he might defeat the deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and indeed, it coſt him not much pains to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his aim. So that in the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were baulked, and could not obtain the handling of the point which they chiefly deſired, that is, the Divine right of Reſidence. They ſpoke to it, indeed, with great freedom, and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monk called <hi>Bartholomè di Carranza</hi> who was afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> took the boldneſs to ſay, that the opinion which held that Reſidence was onely of Papal right, was Diabolical. The Cardinal <hi>di Santa Croce</hi> was of the mind that according to the Memoires ſent from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſomething ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: but the Legate <hi>di Monte</hi> ſtood his ground and carried it, that no ſatisfaction ſhould be given them. At length the Legates framed the Decree of Reformation, containing fifteen Chapters, and propoſed it to a general Congregation. It ſhould have ſeemed that by that Decree, there had been a deſign of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging ſomewhat to thoſe who demanded a Reformation, and eſpecially as to the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Benefices; but in the main there was nothing leſs, becauſe to that Article, and to all the reſt, it was always added, <hi>ſaving in all things the Authority of the holy See;</hi> which rendred all the promiſes of Reformation uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, becauſe the Pope continued ſtill abſolute Maſter of all The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and particularly the Biſhop of <hi>Badajox</hi> found fault with it, would have had that clauſe left out, and that the Pope ſhould not have the power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe againſt the Canons: But it was to no
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99003:129"/>purpoſe for them to proteſt and declare againſt it, it muſt needs go ſo. They urged that the Cardinals might be expreſly named in the prohibition of poſſeſſing ſeveral Benefices; but that as all the reſt was refuſed them. Theſe Decrees, which ſeemed to rectifie the abuſe concerning the Plurality of Benefices, approved nevertheleſs a certain conſtitution of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. called <hi>de Multa,</hi> which condemning the Plurality of Benefices, does notwithſtanding permit it, provided one have a Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome.</hi> This, to ſpeak properly, is to do nothing at all, for what is prohibited in ſhew, is in effect permitted by the benefit of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> withſtood this, deſiring that the Pope might not have power to give Diſpenſations for poſſeſſing ſeveral Benefices: But the Plurality of Votes gained by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, were for approving of the Decrees. The Reformation of abuſes about the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments was put off to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seſſion, becauſe the matter had not been ſufficiently examined.</p>

He therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſickneſs; but none of all thoſe learned

On the matter of the Sacraments in general, fourteen <hi>Anathema's</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; ſeventeen concerning Baptiſm, and three about Confirmation, which may be ſeen in the Decrees of the Council. Afterwards the Decree of Reformation, containing fifteen Articles was read. According to the model of the Legates, it was ordained that no man ſhould be made a Biſhop, but he that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in lawfull Marriage, of mature Age, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of approved Life and Converſation; that one ſingle man ſhould not be capable of holding ſeveral Biſhopricks neither in Title nor <hi>Commendum,</hi> nor by way of Union during life, and the ſame was appointed as to inferiour Benefices. There were alſo Orders made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Licences <hi>de promovendo,</hi> made uſe of by the undeſerving, for obtaining Orders from others than their own Biſhops, to avoid being examined; there were likewiſe ſome againſt Exemptions whereby the Members of the Clergy declined the juriſdiction of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries. But all theſe things put together made but a very ſuperficial Reformation: and what might otherways have been good was overthrown by the clauſe <hi>Salvâ authoritate ſedis Apoſtolicae.</hi> The Biſhops who had withſtood it in the Congregations renewed their oppoſition in the Seſſion,<note place="margin">The Legates make a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Council, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of bad Air.</note> but with leſs heat, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſucceſs.</p>

The Legates kept it private, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Pope's inſtructions ſought for a ſpecious pretext of removal. By good luck ſome diſtempers broke out at <hi>Trent,</hi> occaſioned by the ſeaſon of the year or the confluence of people; and next day a Biſhop died. The Phyſicians were hereupon conſulted, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Gieronimo Fracaſtorio,</hi> who had the Title of Phyſician to the Council. Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gave out what they had orders to ſay: the report was preſently ſpread abroad upon this, that the Plague was in the Town, that the City of <hi>Verona</hi> was about to prohibit all commerce with <hi>Trent,</hi> and all the Prelates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare to be gone. In fine, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates having managed the matter with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Artifice, finding that it was now time to declare themſelves, called a Congregation and intreated the Prelates to take their meaſures as to the inconvenience that threatned them. On the ninth of <hi>March</hi> the Atteſtation of the Phyſicians was publickly read: and the moſt timorous, and thoſe who were in the Plot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that they would be gone. At length, after many Propoſals of remedies to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> propoſed the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, telling them that he had power to do it. The Imperialiſts and <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to ſmell out the trick, and upon the ſpot made anſwer that the diſtemper was not yet ſo great, as to break up an Aſſembly of that Importance, or to remove it to any other place, that thoſe who were moſt afraid might have liberty to be gone, and that the next Seſſion might be put off for ſome Months. The Imperialiſts being
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99003:131"/>come out informed themſelves of the truth of the report that was ſpread abroad concerning the Contagion, and found it to be a mere contrivance of the Legates. Next day, being the tenth of <hi>March</hi> another Congregation was held upon the ſame Subject: and the Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> propoſed the City of <hi>Bologna</hi> as a place whither the Council might be removed. The Imperialiſts oppoſed it again; but to no purpoſe; the tranſlation was reſolved upon, and the Decree for it drawn up. The day following, the eleventh of <hi>March</hi> the eighth Seſſion was held, wherein the Decree of the tranſlation of the Council to <hi>Bologna</hi> was read.

Eight Biſhops or more were gone before the Seſſion: ſo that in all there was not above threeſcore Biſhops in the Council, as there had not been in that which was held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Julius</hi> III.

Cardinal <hi>Sfondrato</hi> the Pope's Legate at this Diet at <hi>Ausbourg</hi> preſſed the Emperour on the other hand to admit of the Tranſlation, plying him with vain hopes of conquering the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which was fallen into Hereſie, and was governed onely by a Child.

The favours which <hi>Maurice</hi> had freſhly received from the Emperour, who had inveſted him in the Electorate whereof Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> had been diſpoſſeſſed, the fear of his arms, and his promiſes wrought upon the Proteſtants to make that falſe ſtep, which yet produced no bad effects for their party in the end. Onely the Electour <hi>Frederic,</hi> a Priſoner ſtript of all, could neither be moved by Prayers nor Threats. The Cardinal of <hi>Trent</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> uſed all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence to obtain the re-eſtabliſhment of

This man followed it cloſe; and ſpoke pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly of the matter in a ſolemn Conſiſtory, which the Pope had called for conferring a Hat on the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was then preſent. The new created Cardinal made a long diſcourſe, which was not favourable to the <hi>Imperialiſts;</hi> for though he did not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe what <hi>Don Diego</hi> had ſaid, yet he did pretty well inſinuate, that the holy See might on this occaſion expect from <hi>France</hi> all kind of aſſiſtance againſt the Imperialiſts. And, in effect, <hi>Henry</hi> the II. in the ſequel, not onely approved the Tranſlation of the Council, but hindered the Pope from giving any ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Emperour as to that point, to the end he might ſet them at variance. The Pope finding himſelf hard put to it, pretended that he would know what was the opinion of the Prelates aſſembled at <hi>Bologna:</hi> He therefore wrote to them, and received their anſwer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had concerted the matter with them; which was, that it was inconſiſtent with the Dignity of the Council to return to <hi>Trent,</hi> that it was neceſſary that the Prelates which remained at <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould firſt rejoyn the body at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and that then they would conſult what was fitteſt to be done, but that it was not reaſonable that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number ſhould give way to the leſſer. The Pope ſignified this anſwer to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99003:134"/>and ratifying the ſame: and he on the other hand was juſt about to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration againſt the Aſſembly at <hi>Bologna</hi> to declare it unlawfull, and to proteſt that all that ſhould be done there ſhould be null and of none effect, had he not been hindered by Cardinal <hi>di Trani</hi> Dean of the ſacred College; ſo that for that time he thought it was enough to inform the Emperour of what had paſt. At the ſame time the Pope made an anſwer to the Letter which he had received from the Church-men of the Diet at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> gave them good words, but in the main refuſed the re-eſtabliſhment of the Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſent them a Copy of the Letter of the Fathers of <hi>Bologna.</hi> The Emperour having learnt the Pope's final reſolution, ſent to <hi>Bologna Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co de Vargas</hi> and <hi>Martino Velaſco,</hi> who appeared before the Fathers of <hi>Bologna</hi> the ſixteenth of <hi>January</hi> with a Letter from the Emperour bearing this ſuperſcription <hi>Conventui Patrum Bononiae;</hi> this Title offended the Aſſembly, and Cardinal <hi>di Monte</hi> interrupted <hi>de Vargas,</hi> telling him that though the Council was not obliged to hear him, ſince the Letter gave not the Council the Title which belonged to them, yet they would without prejudice give him Audience. <hi>Vargas</hi> ſpoke ſmartly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to return to <hi>Trent:</hi> But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Legate anſwered proudly, that he was Preſident of the ſacred Council, Legate of <hi>Paul</hi> III. the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, that he declared the Council to have been lawfully transferred, and that no threatnings could hinder him from continuing it.

But <hi>Charles</hi> was not much concerned at theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces: he briskly anſwered the Pope, that his Conduct did infinitely diſpleaſe him, and that he ſhould take notice, that he could no longer ſuffer the Calumnies which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſpread abroad of him, as if he intended to make a Schiſm in the Church becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the re-eſtabliſhment of the Council at <hi>Trent:</hi> that as to the City of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> it was a Town of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which the Popes had unjuſtly invaded within a few years; that if the Church had any Right to it, he ſhould make it out, and that he would doe him Juſtice.

Nevertheleſs, that he might not abſolutely break with the <hi>Germans</hi> who he feared might make a general revolt, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99003:138"/>leſt in imitation of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>England, Charles</hi> might declare himſelf Head of the Church, he reſolved to ſend two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, not for executing the Edict of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to give Abſolution to the. <hi>Lutherans</hi> who ſhould return into the Boſome of the Church; with power to grant all manner of Diſpenſations, even as far as to allow the Communion in both kinds to thoſe who would confeſs that the Church doth not err in prohibiting it. He gave them likewiſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to abrogate ſome of the Ceremonies of the Church, and to remit ſomewhat of the ancient Diſcipline. He empowred them not onely to abſolve Seculars, Princes and Towns, but alſo Apoſtate Monks who had left their Monaſteries; allowing them to live abroad in the World, provided that under the habit of Secular Prieſts, they ſhould wear that of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars. This laſt ſeemed a pretty odd kind of an Order, and a Myſtery that no body could tell what to make of. He cauſed Copies of this Bull to be diſperſed, that ſo he might thwart the Edict of <hi>Charles,</hi> and retreive the poſſeſſion of the power of Reforming Manners and Doctrine which the Emperour would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded.

This ſubſtitution then was made, but it ſignified nothing, for the Catholicks who perſiſted in their obedience, would not make uſe of the Indulgence which the Bull allowed, and the Proteſtants on the other hand, would hold nothing from the Pope's Liberality.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99003:140"/>would not be againſt the reſtitution of the Council, provided that it might onely ſerve for the ruine of Hereticks, and not for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Authority of the holy See. What difficulties ſoever he made as to that; yet they quickly began to have hopes of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them, becauſe after his exaltation he gave himſelf wholly over to pleaſure and eaſe. <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza</hi> wrote to the Emperour that the Pope grew effeminate in his pleaſures, and that he would not retain vigour enough to reſiſt thoſe importunities that might create him trouble. Being raiſed to the height of Dignity, he thought himſelf no longer obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to live under conſtraint, and therefore giving way to his inclinations he led a pretty eaſie and ſoft kind of a life. Nay, and in the very beginning of his Pontificate he committed an action which confirmed the ſuſpicions that men had conceived, that his pleaſures had been none of the moſt gentile and innocent. And that was, that when according to the cuſtome, upon his exaltation to the Papacy he was to diſpoſe of his Cardinals hat, he gave it to a man of ſo baſe extraction, that his name and family are ſtill unknown in the World; all that could be ſaid of him was, that he was born in the City of <hi>Piacenza. Giovanni Maria di Monte,</hi> who was then but Biſhop of <hi>Siponto</hi> and Governour of <hi>Bologna,</hi> took that young boy into his Service, and had ſo great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for him, that he uſed him as if he had been his own Son. When he was Legate at <hi>Trent,</hi> this Favorite fell ſick; he ſent him to <hi>Verona</hi> for change of Air, and after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, knowing what day he was to return,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99003:140"/>he carried his retinue with him out of Town, under pretext of a walk on the rode to <hi>Verona,</hi> where having met him, he received him with extraordinary Careſſes: and, at length, when he was Pope, he obliged his Brother to adopt the Boy who was called <hi>Innocent,</hi> and ſo gave him the Name of <hi>Innocent di Monte,</hi> making him at the ſame time both his Nephew and Cardinal.

Firſt, becauſe that the place might be ſuſpected by the <hi>French,</hi> that the Emperour would give that Nation all the ſecurity that might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be demanded, to the end that they might ſend their Prelates to the Council; as he on his part had promiſed <hi>Henry,</hi> that the Council ſhould make no Impeachments of the Liberties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church. Secondly, that the Actions of the Council might be haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, to leſſen the great expence that the Pope was at during the ſitting of it. Thirdly, that he would oblige the Proteſtants to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, and to receive the Deciſions which had been already paſt therein. And in the fourth place that he would be pleaſed to take upon him the Care of maintaining the Authority of the holy See againſt the attempts of ſo many ill affected People. As to the firſt the Emperour anſwered that it was juſt that <hi>France</hi> ſhould have all manner of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. To the ſecond, that it was very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the Council ſhould be employed in buſineſs ſo long as it continued. To the third, that in the laſt Diet he had obtained the conſent of the Proteſtants to ſubmit to the Council; but that it was not time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the Queſtion, to wit, whether the things that have been decided might be reviewed or not, that that was more proper to be handled
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99003:142"/>in the Council. And as to the laſt, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, that he had always been the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour of the Dignity of the holy See, and that he would ſtill continue to be ſo. The Pope was not very well ſatisfied with the Anſwer to the third Article: For the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was reſolved never to conſent that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters decided in the former Seſſions ſhould be again reviewed, and according to the Anſwer of <hi>Charles,</hi> the Pope was afraid that his deſign was to favour the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who demanded the reviſing of the Decrees. But he diſſembled his thoughts as to the anſwer, and acted as if that Article had been really concluded, and upon that foot formed the Bull of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> continued the Diet at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> and preſſed the Proteſtants hard to confirm the promiſe, that they made him of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Council. But the Ambaſſadours of ſome Proteſtant Princes, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the Electour of <hi>Saxony,</hi> declared that they could not ſubmit to it, unleſs, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were granted them.
<list>
                        <item>1. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which had been made at <hi>Trent</hi> might be reviewed.</item>
                        <item>2. That the Council ſhould be free.</item>
                        <item>3. That the Proteſtant-Divines might have a Vote in it.</item>
                        <item>4. That the Pope ſhould not preſide therein.</item>
                        <item>5. That the Biſhops ſhould be freed from the Oath which they had taken to the Pope.</item>
                     </list> However the greateſt part of the Proteſtants pretended to ſubmit to the Council with leſs Limitation, becauſe at that Diet as at the former the Emperour was in arms, and they had not liberty to ſpeak what they thought. The Emperour had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99003:142"/>of the Pope that he would ſend him the Minute of the Bull of Convocation before he publiſhed it. But the Pope would not, as not thinking it conſiſtent with his Dignity, nor the Character of Head of the Church to ſubmit the Examination of Bulls before they were formed, to the Judgment and Cenſure of a Secular Prince. He ſent it him dated, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and ſealed, but not as yet publiſhed.<note place="margin">The Bull of Convocation was ſent to the Emperour who did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently propoſe it to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was too high and lofty.</note> It was not preſently communicated to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, becauſe the Emperour thought that it would onely ſerve to incenſe them the more, ſeeing the Pope extremely magnified his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therein. He called himſelf the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, and took ſolely to himſelf the power of calling and preſiding in Councils. The Emperour uſed all the intereſt that he could at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pope to make him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: but the Pope continued firm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible in his reſolution, and fell even into a kind of Paſſion when the propoſal was made to him. And that he might put a ſtop to the Suits and Importunities that were made to him about that affair; he publiſhed a Brief for the Publication and Confirmation of the Bull, cauſing both of them to be affixed on the Gates of the Churches of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran.</hi> The Emperour therefore, finding that he could obtain nothing, cauſed the Bull to be read in the Diet, where it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the very effects which he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. The Proteſtants recalled their promiſe, and the Catholicks themſelves condemned that haughty and lofty Conduct at ſo unſeaſonable a time. <hi>Charles</hi> eſſayed to allay the diſorders, promiſing poſitively that notwithſtanding the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99003:143"/>expreſſions in the Bull, he would ſo order matters that all, even the Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould receive ſatisfaction; he paſt his word that he would keep himſelf within near diſtance of the Council, where he might have an Eye upon the Conduct and Proceedings of that Aſſembly. And ſo on the thirteenth of <hi>February</hi> 1551. the Receſs of the Diet was made, the Concluſion whereof was that after the re-eſtabliſhment of the Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> all <hi>Germany</hi> ſhould with a ſubmiſſive ſpirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what ſhould there be decreed: that the Emperour ſhould be there, and give orders that all might freely propoſe what they had to ſay, and that he ſhould bring matters ſo about that the Controverſies ſhould be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Scriptures and Fathers. That did not at all pleaſe the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they eaſily perceived that that Edict was made to laſh the Bull. The Pope in the Bull declared that he alone had Right to govern the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to preſide therein, and to preſcribe the manner of proceeding; and the Emperour in the Receſs engaged himſelf to govern the Council, according as the ſhould think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: Nay more, he promiſed therein matters which he could not perform without obliging the Council to follow a Conduct quite oppoſite to that which had been obſerved in the firſt Convocation. Nevertheleſs the Pope went on to accompliſh what was neceſſary for the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Council. He named but one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to aſſiſt at it in his name <hi>Marcello Creſcenoci</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Marco;</hi> and inſtead of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Legate gave him two <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s for Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, <hi>Sebaſtian Pighini</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto,</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:99003:143"/>and <hi>Luigi Lipomani</hi> Boſhop of <hi>Verona;</hi> the firſt becauſe of the intimate Friendſhip that he had had with him, and the other becauſe of the great reputation of integrity that he was had in. He diſcovered his Secrets to them, gave them their Commiſſion, and ordered them to open the Council the firſt of <hi>May</hi> the ſame year 1551. without farther delay, though none ſhould be there but themſelves alone, as the Legates of <hi>Martin</hi> V. had done, who opened the Council of <hi>Pavia</hi> without the aſſiſtance of any Prelate.</p>

                  <p>About that time, that is to ſay, a little before the opening of the Council, there happened a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99003:144"/>troubleſome Accident which hindered the <hi>French</hi> Prelates from coming to <hi>Trent,</hi> as King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had promiſed, had bred a quarrel betwixt the Pope and the King.<note place="margin">The Pope claſhes with the King of <hi>France.</hi> The King ſends not his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Council.</note> 
                     <hi>Otta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio Farneſe</hi> Grandchild of the late Pope and Son-in-Law to the Emperour, having married <hi>Margarite</hi> his natural Daughter, and been by <hi>Julius</hi> III. reſtored to the Poſſeſſion of the City of <hi>Parma. Charles</hi> the fifth that he might become more powerfull and get greater foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Italy</hi> had a deſign to ſeize that Town, as he had already ſeized <hi>Piaoenza</hi> and another part of the <hi>Parmeſan,</hi> after the murther of <hi>Pietro Luigi, Ottavio</hi>'s father, purpoſing to give his Son-in-Law an Eſtate elſewhere in lieu of it. <hi>Ottavio</hi> fearing the deſigns of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his Father-in-Law, and the boldneſs of <hi>Ferrante Gonzaga</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Neighbour, put himſelf under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>France,</hi> and received a <hi>French</hi> Gariſon into <hi>Parma.</hi> The Emperour was extremely vexed at that, and found means to perſwade the Pope, that that enterpriſe was very Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to his Authority, ſince that City ought to be conſidered as part of the Eccleſiaſtick State, becauſe <hi>Ottavio</hi> held it of none but the Pope, who had been pleaſed to put him in poſſeſſion thereof. <hi>Ottavio</hi> had acted nothing in that affair without having in ſome manner obtained the Pope's permiſſion; for he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> either that they would protect him againſt the Enterpriſes of the Emperour, or that he might be permitted to take the beſt Courſe he could for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Place, according as he ſhould judge moſt convenient, which was granted him.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99003:145"/>However <hi>Julius</hi> who had not foreſeen the Conſequences of the permiſſion which he had granted, being ſolicited by the Emperour, without more adoe broke out into rage; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an Edict againſt <hi>Ottavio,</hi> cited him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in caſe of Non-appearance declared him a Rebel, and implored the Emperour's Aſſiſtance againſt him. The Emperour gave a favourable anſwer, and promiſed the Pope aſſiſtance to reduce <hi>Ottavio</hi> to reaſon. The King of <hi>France</hi> ſent <hi>de Terme</hi> Ambaſſadour to <hi>Rome,</hi> to pacifie the Pope, and to give him to underſtand that he had not taken upon him the Protection of <hi>Parma</hi> with any other deſign than the preſervation of the liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth intended to oppreſs. <hi>De Terme</hi> finding the Pope ſtiff, told him that if he were for war, the Council might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and that though it were continued in being, yet it could not be called a General Council, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> Prelates could not be there; nay he did not ſpare to tell him, that his Maſter would be ready enough to take arms, and make uſe of the means that his Anceſtours had employed againſt the Popes who had ſhew'd themſelves Partial. The Pope hereupon fell into a Paſſion, and told him that if the King took <hi>Parma</hi> from him, he would take <hi>France</hi> and the Commerce of all Chriſtendom from the King. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he huft at this rate, yet he was ſtill in great fear; and therefore gave orders to the Biſhop of <hi>Imola</hi> his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to acquaint the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with all that had paſt betwixt him and the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> and withall gave him inſtructions to engage the Emperour
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99003:145"/>as much as poſſible he could to the Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome. Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> having in vain eſſayed to move the Pope by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threatnings, began to act. And in the firſt place, he ſent orders to all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of his Kingdom, to repair to their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes within ſix Months, to prepare themſelves for a National Council. This order was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops and Cardinals that were at <hi>Rome</hi> in great number. They obeyed, and the Pope durſt not withſtand it. That blow a little amazed him, and made him reſolve to ſpeak more mildly. He therefore ſent <hi>Aſcanio Della Corna</hi> his Nephew into <hi>France,</hi> with orders to beſtir himſelf with all poſſible diligence, to prevail with the King not to protect the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> who was his Vaſſal and in Rebellion againſt him; and to break off the deſign of a National Council, by repreſenting to him that it was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Schiſm. The King to be even with the Pope in matter of civility ſent to him <hi>Monluc,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> Elect; but theſe Negotiations produced no effect, becauſe neither Party would yield in any thing. The King would not abandon the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Pope would not be pacified. It is certain that it was the intereſt of the Pope, as well as of all <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Ottavio</hi> ſhould ſecure <hi>Parma</hi> againſt the deſigns of the Emperour: and the Power of the <hi>French</hi> who had nothing in <hi>Italy,</hi> ought to have been far leſs formidable to the <hi>Italians</hi> than the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who was already ſo powerfull amongſt them; and therefore no body could tell what to make of the Pope's
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99003:146"/>Conduct. That was the reaſon that made ſome caſt about to find out ſome Myſtery in it; and to imagine that ſince he could not be ignorant of his own intereſt, he had onely declared againſt the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> to ſet the Emperour and King of <hi>France</hi> together by the ears; that ſo he might put a ſtop to the Progreſs of the Council, which he had called againſt his Will. And indeed it was obſerved that the Pope did not ſeem much concerned about the affairs of the Council, after it had been opened. It was not ſo with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for as he had taken a great deal of pains to have it renewed, ſo was he very ſolicitous to oblige the Proteſtants to repair to it.<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants prepare to ſend their Divines to the Council.</note> 
                     <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> who under a feigned Compliance was hatching great deſigns, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his Divines, and commanded <hi>Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> to gather together the Articles which were to be propoſed to the Council. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> Duke of <hi>Wittemberg</hi> did the like, and the Divines having mutually communicated their Writings, they found that they agreed in all matters. But before they would ſet out on their Journey to <hi>Trent,</hi> they deſired a ſafe Conduct from the Council, beſides what they had from the Emperour; that they might not fall into the misfortune of <hi>John Huſs,</hi> who was burnt at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſafe Conduct of <hi>Sigiſmond. Charles</hi> promiſed them this ſafe Conduct, and ſent three Ambaſſadours to the Council with full power to act and doe all that he could doe and act himſelf, if he were perſonally preſent. Theſe Plenipotentiaries were <hi>Hugh</hi> Count of <hi>Montfort, Don Franciſco de Toledo</hi> Prior
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99003:146"/>of <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Champaigne.</hi> The Emperour by his ſolicitations prevailed with the Electours of <hi>Cologne, Mentz</hi> and <hi>Treves,</hi> and as many <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops as he could, to goe thither; and yet, in that Council which laſted Eight months, there were not above threeſcore and four Prelates, including the Preſidents and Eccleſiaſtick Princes.</p>

                  <p>After the Ceremonies were over, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Council read a long exhortation which the Legates had given him, tending in General to perſwade all to a peaceable temper of mind, that all their actions might be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with Calmneſs; then was the Decree read, which contained nothing but the Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the next Seſſion to be the Eleventh of <hi>October</hi> forty days after, and an intimation that after the Sacraments in general, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Baptiſm and Confirmation were handled, they would in that enſuing Seſſion decide the Controverſies of the Euchariſt; and treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reformation in matters that obſtruct Reſidence.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99003:147"/>
                     <hi>Eccleſiam malignantium</hi> the Aſſembly of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants. That Letter accuſed the Pope and excuſed <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof he made a Complement to the Fathers of the Aſſembly of <hi>Trent,</hi> and offered to make them Judges of the Debate he had with the Pope about the Buſineſs of <hi>Parma;</hi> but the concluſion was in another Style; for <hi>Amiot</hi> proteſted by word and by writing in name of his Maſter, that he could not own that for a General Council wherein the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops could not be preſent, declaring that they could not be ſent, becauſe <hi>Trent</hi> was no ſecure place for them, and that through the Pope's Conduct the King and his Prelates were excluded the Council. He added that his Maſter would take his courſe by the Law of Arms to have reparation of the injuries that were done him, and deſired that he might have an inſtrument of his Proteſtation; he was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that inſtrument, and told that he ſhould have an anſwer the next Seſſion. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation had been already made at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>De Terme,</hi> but had not come to the knowledge of many. Here it was made publickly, in ſight of all the World, and furniſhed matter for converſation and for the reflexions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians. The Imperialiſts ſlighted it, and ſaid that the greater number carries it over the leſſer, that the <hi>French</hi> had been invited to the Council, and that if they refuſed to come, it could be no prejudice to its Authority. But there were others who made more ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon it, and did not think that that could be called a General Council, which was onely compoſed of <hi>Italians, Spaniards</hi> and ſome
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99003:148"/>few <hi>Germans.</hi> The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted great weight to the King's Proteſtation, and maintained that the greater number carries it not over the leſſer, but in affairs where the intereſt is not common: but that in common intereſts <hi>prohibentis conditio eſt potior,</hi> the right of the oppoſers is ſtrongeſt. They farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Churches which are not preſent in a Council, are not obliged by its Decrees, which was a thing never queſtioned amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients: ſeeing that after Councils had been held, the Decrees paſt in them were ſent to all abſent Churches to have their Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without which in thoſe Churches they could not bind nor have the force of a Law. The ſober, diſcreet and charitable ſort made a third Party, blamed the King as having given the Council a mortal ſtab, and laid a ground for a prejudice againſt it, which would be very hard to remove. Could one think or perſwade himſelf that the Holy Ghoſt could have preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Council, againſt which a moſt Chriſtian King, Eldeſt Son of the Church and a great Perſecutor of all new Sects, had made a Proteſtation? however the King of <hi>France</hi> ſtopt not there; he publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, and made a prohibition that no money ſhould be carried to <hi>Rome</hi> upon pretext of Diſpenſations, <hi>Annates</hi> or any other Title. That <hi>Manifeſto</hi> was verified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where a great liberty was taken in ſpeaking eſpecially againſt Diſpenſations, which they termed Shams and Tricks, incapable of giving any aſſurance to Conſciences. Whilſt <hi>Henry</hi> proceeded in this manner againſt the Pope, that he might not be ſuſpected of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99003:148"/>he doubled his perſecutions againſt the Proteſtants, made more rigorous Edicts againſt them, and inflicted ſevere puniſhments upon a great many.

This diſtinction did not go down neither at <hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Trent;</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> maintained that the Pope and the holy See were one and the ſame thing.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99003:149"/>by Scripture, the Fathers and Councils, avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all nice and ſuperfluous Queſtions: but this Order was not acceptable to the <hi>Italians</hi> who were very quaint in School-Divinity, but ignorant in all things elſe; the <hi>Germans</hi> liked it ſomewhat better, becauſe the Diſputes which they had had with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had obliged them to ſtudy Languages, the Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the Scripture. The <hi>Italians</hi> made Speeches againſt that Method, and pleaded the cauſe of Ratiocination againſt Authorities. They alledged that there needed no more but a good Memory to collect paſſages, and that that Method gave the <hi>Lutherans</hi> the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory who were excellent in ſuch kind of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and skilfull in Grammar-learning for the interpretation of paſſages. They had as good have ſaid nothing; for the Order paſt, though to no great purpoſe, for it hindered not Scholaſtick Diſputations, as will appear hereafter.</p>
                  <p>They came to the examination of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles concerning the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, every one gave his opinion thereupon, and it ſuffered no great debate. The ſecond was againſt thoſe who ſay that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not eaten ſacramentally but ſpiritually; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thought the queſtion to be of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, becauſe the Hereticks did not deny but that our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was eaten ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally. The third was againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Impanators,</hi> who maintain the aſſumption of Bread, and its hypoſtatick Union with the body of our Lord; but they were told that that opinion which was the opinion of <hi>Robert Abbot</hi> of <hi>Tuits</hi> was dead with himſelf above
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99003:149"/>four hundred years ago, and that it had no aſſerters. There was ſome Diſpute on the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins</hi> ſide about the neceſſity of Confeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Communion, which is mentioned in the laſt of theſe ten Articles, and they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that many able and holy Catholicks had been of the judgment that it was not always neceſſary. The eighth and ninth Articles that relate to the Communion in both kinds took up longer time. The Divines enlarged in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Communion in one kind was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but the Diſpute laſted not long; for they came to an agreement to reduce thoſe ten Articles into ſeven Canons, fortified with <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt the enemies of the Real Preſence, Tranſubſtantiation, Adoration, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under one kind, and againſt thoſe who condemn the other Opinions and Rites of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in relation to the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. It was likewiſe reſolved that Chapters ſhould be made on this head, as had been done about the point of Juſtification, and not to reſt barely on Canons as was done in the matter of the Sacraments in general. This rejoyced the <hi>Italians,</hi> who thought they had got their revenge on the <hi>Germans,</hi> becauſe for forming of thoſe Chapters of Doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be had to their School-Divinity, which had been neglected in framing of the Canons. Theſe Chapters were reduced to eight in number, of which there was one that handled the point of the Communion in both kinds, againſt the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>Upon this occaſion the Count <hi>de Montfort</hi> and the reſt of the Emperour's Ambaſſadours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed and alledged that the matter of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99003:150"/>Cup was a popular thing, known of all, and that it was one of the ſtumbling-blocks to the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany;</hi> that it ought not to be decided unleſs they were preſent at the Council; that to come thither as they had promiſed, they deſired a ſafe Conduct from the Council as well as from the Emperour. They demanded that ſafe Conduct, and prayed that they might forbear treating about matter of Doctrine, and apply themſelves to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wherein they would find buſineſs enough. The Legates and <hi>Nuncio's</hi> refuſed to ſuperſede the examination of points of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but inſiſted not much on the Article of retrenching the Cup, nor the ſafe Conduct. They expreſſed themſelves onely in general terms telling them that they would next Seſſion take it into conſideration, and immediately acquainted the Pope with all. The Pope took Council about the matter; the reſult of which was, that though there was no hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> yet that they might have no pretext of complaining, they ſhould defer the point of retrenching the Cup, but that that delay ſhould not extend beyond three Months. The matter of a ſafe Conduct ſuffered more difficulty; for moſt part were againſt the granting of it, becauſe no Council had ever done it, but that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the leaſt action whereof they ſcrupled to imitate; they added that the coming of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to the Council, would onely ſerve to ſeduce people, becauſe they would not forbear their Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cant; that on the whole, if they refuſed to ſubmit, that ſafe conduct would be diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Council, from which they required
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99003:150"/>a compliance which ought never to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Hereticks. To remove all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they thought of giving a ſafe Conduct in general terms, wherein the Proteſtants ſhould not be named, but onely deſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of Church-men and Seculars of the <hi>German</hi> Nation; that ſo if at any other time neceſſity did require, they might ſay that by theſe terms none were meant but Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Whilſt they were conſulting at <hi>Rome</hi> about the ſafe Conduct, at <hi>Trent</hi> points of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine were under examination, and that inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was not ſo calm and peaceable, as the other about the <hi>Anathema's</hi> and Canons againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; for it was impoſſible to keep the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> and <hi>Cordeliers</hi> from going together by tho ears about the matter of Tranſubſtantiation. The <hi>Jacobins</hi> pretended that the body of our Saviour is made preſent in the Euchariſt by way of Production, becauſe the Body of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> without coming down from Heaven, where it is in its natural being, is rendered preſent in the Bread by a reproduction of the ſame ſubſtance, according to which Doctrine the ſubſtance, according to which Doctrine the ſubſtance of the Bread is changed into the ſubſtance of our Lord's Body. The <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> on the other hand, defended that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation which is called Adductive, they alledged that our Lord's Body is brought down from Heaven, not by a ſucceſſive, but momentany change, and that the ſubſtance of Bread is not changed into the ſubſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but that the Fleſh and Bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſucceeds into the place of the ſubſtance of the Bread, being convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither from another place. Each Party
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99003:151"/>maintained their opinions with wonderfull heat, branding one anothers with abſurdities and contradictions. The Electour of <hi>Cologne</hi> who had had the patience to hear theſe wretched janglings, ſaid very pleaſantly, that both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in the right when they refuted, and charged one another with abſurdities; but that they ſeemed all of them to be out of the way when they aſſerted their opinions; becauſe they ſpoke nothing that was Senſe or Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; at length ſeeing there was no declaring for one Party without offending the other, they ſatisfied them both by couching the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in very general terms. In the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation they diſcourſed of many abuſes that concerned the Euchariſt, which ought to be reformed: ſuch as are the failings in reverence and reſpect to the holy Sacrament. It was complained of, that they did not kneel before it, that they let it mould in the <hi>Pixes,</hi> that it was adminiſtred with little reverence, and that they took money from Communicants. This laſt abuſe was committed particularly at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Communicants carried in one hand a hollow Taper, and a piece of money in the Taper, which was the Prieſts ſee. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that Canons ſhould be made againſt that abuſe, and many more of the like nature.</p>

The end the Biſhops propoſed to themſelves was not the rectifying of the abuſes of that Juriſdiction, by reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the juſt and lawfull bounds whereby
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99003:151"/>it was limited in the Apoſtles time, and in the primitive Ages of the Church; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they would have enlarged it by exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it from the power and attempts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> That Juriſdiction in the firſt Ages was onely grounded on the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſt epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts believers not to bring their Cauſes before Infidels, but to chuſe out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves fit perſons to compoſe their differences: but becauſe the Tribunal which St. <hi>Paul</hi> eſtabliſhes in that place was merely a tribunal of Charity, which had no coercive power, ſo the Sentences that paſt there were onely Verdicts of Arbitration, which men ſtood by if they thought fit: by the ſix and fiftieth Chapter of the ſecond Book of the Conſtitutions attributed to St. <hi>Clement,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Biſhop and Prieſts met every Munday for determining the affairs of their Flock. And it rarely happened that any one appealed from theſe Deciſions, becauſe of the great reſpect that men in thoſe days had for the Church. But after the times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were over, the Biſhops ſupported by the Emperours who were become Chriſtians erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Real Tribunals, the Decrees and Sentences whereof were put in execution by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Magiſtrate. It is ſaid, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> ordained that the Sentences of Biſhops ſhould be without appeal, and be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by the Secular Judges; and that if one of the Parties ſhould deſire that a Proceſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced before a Secular Judge, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Tribunal of the Biſhop, the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould be granted in ſpight of all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99003:152"/>either from the Judge or the adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In the year three hundred ſixty five the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> enlarged that Jurisdiction, and <hi>Poſſidius</hi> reports that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was taken up in thoſe trials of Civil matters many times even till night, which troubled him much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it took him off from the true functions of his Miniſtery. That Law of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in favour of this Tribunal of Biſhops was revoked, or at leaſt limited by the Emperours <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius:</hi> for they ordained that Biſhops ſhould decide in no Cauſes but thoſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in Civil matters, when both Parties conſented to it. In the year four hundred and fifty two, the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Law which reſtrained the power of Biſhops: <hi>Juſtinian</hi> reſtored to them part of what they had been deprived of, allowing them beſides the Cauſes of Conſcience, power to take cognizance of the Crimes of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and to perform ſeveral other acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over <hi>Laics.</hi> And thus by the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet favour of Emperours, the power of the Church which is all Spiritual became a Carnal Dominion. In the following Ages the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Authority of the Biſhops got ground apace, and eſpecially in the Weſtern Church; becauſe the chief of the Clergy were the ableſt Stateſmen; they were commonly of Princes Councils, and managed and Civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. That was the reaſon that in a ſhort time they grew to be ſole Judges of all Cauſes Civil and Criminal of the Clergy, and that they extended their Juriſdiction over <hi>Laicks</hi> under various pretexts: for inſtance they took upon them to Judge of the Validity of laſt Will
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99003:152"/>and Teſtaments, to make Inventories and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Seals, under pretext that Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans are recommended to the care of the Church. Heretofore all contracts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and ratified by Oath, and becauſe an Oath is a matter of Conſcience, they made themſelves Judges of all Cauſes that related to Contracts and Promiſes. Beſides theſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions they eſtabliſhed a Court which they called <hi>the Mixt Court</hi> wherein they Judged of all civil Cauſes belonging to the Magiſtrate; if the Court of the Church had by anticipation taken cognizance of the Cauſe; but on the other ſide if the Magiſtrate had anticipated them, then the Eccleſiaſtick-Court had no more Power. They likewiſe laid down for a Maxim, which brought a great many Cauſes before them, that when the Magiſtrate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected or refuſed to doe Juſtice, then the Cauſe devolved to the Eccleſiaſtick-Court: And in fine, to fill up the meaſure of corruption, in the eleventh Century, they laboured to lay down this for a Maxim that Biſhops did not derive this great Power from the Conceſſions of Princes, but immediately from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Otherwiſe if the Biſhops had acknowledged that they held theſe Privileges from Princes; Sovereigns would have always had power to puniſh them, and rectifie the abuſes committed by them in their Juriſdiction. But that they might put themſelves out of reach of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion, they perſwaded People that their Juriſdiction was independent of the Power of Princes. At laſt, that they might frame an Empire Paramount over all the States of Chriſtendom, the Pope was made Head of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99003:153"/>that Juriſdiction which the Biſhops had uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and reared up within the ſpace of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years. For after that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had taken from Magiſtrates a great part of their Juriſdicton, the Pope found a way to ſtrip the Ordinaries of the greateſt part of their Power, by Evocations, Appeals, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions. So that if on the one hand the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judges complained of the uſurpations of the Biſhops: on the other hand the Biſhops complained of the encroachments of the holy See. This in general, was the matter that then was handled in the Congregations of the Canoniſts, whilſt in the others, matters of Faith were examined.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Gropper</hi> who was in the Council both as a Lawyer and a Divine, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned accurately about theſe abuſes of Juriſdiction, and ſhew'd that in the beginning, the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Biſhops were ſentences of Charity; that theſe ſentences were rendered not by Officials as now a-days; but by the Biſhop and Prieſts aſſembled in a kind of Conſiſtory or Synod. That moreover, there was no ſuch thing known as Appeals from thoſe ſentences to the Pope, that if any Appeal was made, it was to their next immediate Superiours which are Synods. And therefore he was of opinion, that theſe Synodal Judgments ſhould be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Courts and Judgments of Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſhould be aboliſhed, and that all Appeals to the Pope immediately, without paſſing through ſubordinate Superiours, ſhould be diſcharged.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99003:153"/>of the Council <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Caſtello</hi> a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi> who in a long harangue maintained that it was lawfull to Appeal immediately to the Pope,<note place="margin">

The Biſhops were not ſatisfied with <hi>Gropper</hi>'s Diſcourſe, but far leſs with that of <hi>Caſtello.</hi> For he raiſed the Authority of the Pope to ſuch a pitch, that the <hi>Italians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves murmured at it, becauſe according to <hi>Caſtello</hi>'s Maxims, the Pope was all in all, and the Biſhops ſignified nothing at all; and that made the <hi>Italians</hi> recoyl and talk of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. In effect they came to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and adjuſted matters in this manner, That there ſhould be no Appeals from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentences of Biſhops and Officials but in cauſes criminal, and that even in criminal matters it ſhould not be lawfull to Appeal from Interlocutory Sentences; untill Definitive Sentence were pronounced. But they would not re-eſtabliſh Synodal Judgments by ruining the Officials. The Biſhops urged not to be re-eſtabliſhed in their ancient right of being Judged by their Synods, that is to ſay, by the Metropolitan, and their Comprovincials; becauſe men are not commonly inclined to facilitate Judgments againſt themſelves, and Proceſſes againſt Biſhops are much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult when one muſt go to <hi>Rome,</hi> or procure a Commiſſion from thence, than if they could be accuſed upon the place before their proper Judges, which are Synods. The power was therefore left to the Pope of Judging them by Commiſſaries delegated <hi>in partibus.</hi> Onely the Council made ſome Regulations, that none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99003:154"/>to the Biſhop in Dignity ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen as a Commiſſary of the Pope, to Judge him. It is one of the Grievances againſt the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and one of the reaſons why it is not received in <hi>France,</hi> that contrary to the ancient Canons, it deprives Biſhops of the right of being Judged by the Metropolitan and their Comprovincials.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their Original and Progreſs.</note>There was alſo another great abuſe in the Juriſdiction of Biſhops, of which a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was demanded, and that was the manner of Degradations. According to the Privileges that have been granted to the Clergy, or which they have uſurped, this Maxim has been long received, that the Magiſtrate has no power over Clerks ſo long as they remain Clerks. So that a Member of the Clergy muſt be degraded before he can be delivered over to the Secular Power, for capital and enormous Crimes, where ſentence of death is to be pronounced, which cannot be given by an Eccleſiaſtick Court, becauſe it imbrues not the hand in Bloud: and this cuſtome was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Laws of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> It was even the cuſtome in preceding Ages, that is, in the fourth and fifth Century, when a Member of the Clergy returned into the World, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade him by the ſame Ceremonies whereby he had been inſtalled, but in a manner inverſe and retrograde, that is to ſay, that they clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed him in all his Prieſtly Habits, and then ſtript him of the ſame one after another, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying words quite contrary to thoſe of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But ſince, about the year ſix hundred, theſe Degradations were aboliſhed; and thoſe who had taken high Orders were prohibited
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99003:154"/>from returning again into the World; ſo that the cuſtome of Degradations is onely retained in Criminal matters, when a Member of the Clergy is to be delivered over to the Secular Power to be puniſhed. But theſe Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Clerks convicted, muſt be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the new Canons, with ſo many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as rendered the puniſhment of the Members of the Clergy almoſt impoſſible. That was their Scope, and they onely clogg'd Degradations with ſo many difficulties, that they might live in impunity. For Degrading a Biſhop, thirteen Degrading Biſhops were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, beſides twelve Aſſiſtants. For Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Prieſt, there muſt be ſix Biſhops, for Degrading a Deacon three Biſhops, whereas for Conſecrating a Biſhop three are ſufficient, and one for Ordaining a Prieſt. How difficult a matter was it to get ſo many Biſhops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how chargeable muſt that be, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Germny,</hi> where Biſhops are very thin and at a great diſtance one from another? Theſe Degradations were performed with great Ceremonies in Pontifical Habit, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary concourſe of People. The matter was very long canvaſſed, but the Council Judged it not expedient to aboliſh the uſe of Degradations, onely it was thought fit to find out ſome way of facilitating them, that they might be done with leſs trouble. Whilſt the Council was thus taken up, the Cardinal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate had time to receive news from <hi>Rome.</hi> So ſoon as it came, without telling the Council that he had written, and without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his anſwers, he called the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and had it concluded according as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99003:155"/>it was reſolved by the Pope, that they ſhould grant the Proteſtants a ſafe Conduct in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, and that they ſhould refer the point of the Cup to another Seſſion. Amongſt the points that were to be handled again, the Communion of young Children was one, and the Article of retrenching the Cup was divided into three others, thereby to multiply them, and that they might not be neceſſitated to reſume a Controverſie which had already been decided, for one point omitted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</p>

                     </note>The eleventh of <hi>October</hi> the Seſſion was held with the uſual Ceremonies. Maſs was ſaid by the Biſhop of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Preached by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Torne.</hi> Then were read the Decree, the Chapters of Doctrine, the Canons and the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s for aſſerting the Real Preſence, the Sacramental Manducation, Tranſubſtantiation, the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy, the Adoration of the Sacrament, the Reſervation of the Kinds, the Neceſſity of Confeſſion, and the other points that were oppoſed by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and Proteſtants. The Decree of Reformation began with a grave Exhortation to Biſhops to uſe their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction moderately, then it ordained that it ſhould not be lawfull to Appeal from the Judgment of Biſhops before Definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. That when there is place for an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and that the Pope ſhall grant Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>in partibus,</hi> that is on the Places, that none ſhall be Commiſſionated but the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan or his great Vicar, and if they be ſuſpected, that none can be Commiſſionated but neighbouring Biſhops. To leſſen the difficulty
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99003:155"/>of Degradations, it ordained that one Biſhop with as many Abbots as the Canons required Biſhops, might Degrade Clerks. To ſatisfie the Biſhops as to Exemptions, it ordained that the Biſhops might Judge of theſe Exemptions and of Favours obtained upon falſe Suggeſtions, and annull them in quality of Subdelegates of the holy See. But the Council reſerved to the Pope the Cogniſance of greater Cauſes, and that the Cauſes of Biſhops, wherein the nature of the crime required Perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be brought before the Pope and be determined by him. In the ſame Decree of Reformation there were ſome other Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that tended a little to the ſatisfaction of the Biſhops, that they might the more caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear the Yoke of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but in all thoſe places where any thing of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was granted them, they had no power to act but in quality of the Delegates of the holy See. After that a Decree for deferring the Article of the Cup, and the Safe-conduct which the Council granted the Proteſtants, were publickly read.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the Electour of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince appear at the Council.</note>At the ſame Seſſion appeared <hi>Chriſtopher Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen</hi> and <hi>John Hofman</hi> Ambaſſadours from <hi>Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi> Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> a Proteſtant Prince. <hi>Chriſtopher Strasfen</hi> one of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours made a long ſpeech, wherein in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civil but general terms he aſſured the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of the reſpect his Maſter had for them, and mentioned nothing at all of the matter of Religion. The Council made anſwer by their Promooter, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things told him, that with much Joy the Fathers had heard from his mouth, that that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99003:156"/>Prince ſubmitted to the Council, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to obey its Decrees: In the mean while, the Ambaſſadour had ſaid no ſuch thing, but they thought they had gained a great point, in ſo interpreting the Complements and civil Expreſſions that the Ambaſſadour had made uſe of. All men made obſervations upon the Conduct of the Electour and the Council. It was eaſily perceived that the Electour inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to obſerve the beſt meaſures he could with the Council, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might not croſs the Election of his Son <hi>Frederick</hi> to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Magdebourg,</hi> which had been made by the Chapter; but the prudence of the Council was much more admired who had ſo dextrouſly turned the ſenſe of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's Complements to an engagement of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. According to the intimation that was made to the Abbot of <hi>Belloſana,</hi> they intended to have given an anſwer to the King of <hi>France,</hi> but no Abbot appeared, he returned by order of his Maſter immediately after he had made his Proteſtation. It was not the mind of the Court of <hi>France</hi> that the Ambaſſadour ſhould expect the Seſſion to enter into a debate which could not in the concluſion but be of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conſequence, ſince the Pope and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> who were the Parties in that affair, muſt alſo have been the Judges. The Apparitours made a Proclamation at the Church-door that if any one was there for the moſt Chriſtian King, he ſhould appear; but though no man appeared, yet the anſwer was read, which contained Complaints of the King's proceedings, and Proteſtations on the part of the Council; that they wore not aſſembled upon any private
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99003:156"/>intereſt, but for the general good of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and the extirpation of Hereſies; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, they prayed him to ſend his Prelates to the Council, not to make uſe of any other means, but to think of his Name of the moſt Chriſtian King, and to ſacrifice his particular Quarrels to the general good of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>The Decrees of the Seſſion were forthwith printed, and all People reflected upon them according to their ſeveral Paſſions and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. The Proteſtants failed not to obſerve a contradiction betwixt the firſt Chapter of Doctrine, and the ſourth with the ſecond Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. In the firſt Chapter the Council ſaith, that hardly can one expreſs the manner of the Real Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and in the ſourth Chapter it ſaith, that that manner hath been <hi>convenienter &amp; proprie</hi> called Tranſubſtantiation, and in the ſecond Canon the Council ſaith, that it is <hi>ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſſime</hi> called ſo; it was likewiſe thought that the Council had made uſe of a kind of an improper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious expreſſion as to the point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; becauſe it ſays that Jeſus Chriſt after the Benediction declared, that that which he gave was his Real Body; which ſeems to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate that the change was made by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, ſo that theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> could be no more but a Declaration of the change that was made, when the Bread was bleſt. Now that would overthrow the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the change is made by theſe words, <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> which were not pronounced but in the diſtribution of the Bread, and ſometime after
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99003:157"/>the Benediction. The Prieſts were very ill ſatisfied that their Yoke was made heavier, by enlarging the Authority of the Biſhops over them: but above all others, the Proteſtants were diſſatisfied at the Decree which was made to delay the examination of the point of the Cup in their Favour. Becauſe that ſuppoſed that they had conſented to admit of all the other Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that they onely diſſented about this; whereas they had always demanded that they ſhould all be reviewed. Nor were they ſatisfied nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Safe-conduct, ſuſpecting it to be a Cheat all over, but chiefly the limitation that was in it in theſe words, <hi>in as much as belongs to the Council.</hi> They looked upon that as a Back-door that the Pope had reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in caſe he intended to uſe violence. And therefore without concerting together any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, they gave about by word of Mouth one from another, That they ought not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any Safe-conduct but in the Form that was granted to the <hi>Bohemians</hi> by the Council of <hi>Baſil;</hi> that is to ſay, that it ſhould be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute without any Reſervation, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhould engage in writing to decide the Controverſies by the Scripture: and concluded that if this were denied them, they ſhould have good reaſon to recall the promiſe that they had made to the Emperour of going and ſubmitting to the Council.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The point of Penance is choſen for the next Seſſion.</note>The day following a general Congregation was held for adjuſting the point of Penance, which was to be handled and decided in the next Seſſion. It was moved in the firſt place, that the Divines had tranſgreſſed the Laws
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99003:157"/>that had been preſcribed to them for their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; that they had not avoided the Quirks of the School and nice Queſtions, which had produced ſcandalous Debates. Therefore the Order was renewed for obliging the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to prove their Propoſitions by Scripture, the Fathers, the Tradition of the Church, Councils, and the Deciſions of Popes. But that took as little effect as the reſt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that nature, and particularly of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Diſputants to a certain time, that they ſhould not be tedious in their Diſcourſes. They who were deputed to make the Abſtracts drew twelve Articles out of the Books of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> concerning Penance, and four about Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, which were delivered to the Divines, and ſubmitted to their Cenſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For preventing of quarrels that might ariſe amongſt the Divines, the Council regulated the Order wherein every one of them ſhould ſpeak: the Pope's Divines were to ſpeak firſt, then thoſe of the Emperour, and next the Divines of <hi>Louvain,</hi> after them the Divines of the Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> then thoſe of the Electours in the Order of the Precedency of their Princes, the Secular Prieſts according to the Order of their Promotion, and laſt of all the Monks or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, one after another, according to the dignity of their Orders. It was alſo ordained that the Congregations ſhould be held twice a day, in the Morning and Afternoon. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward there was a Collection made of fifteen Articles concerning Reformation to employ the Congregations of the Canoniſts. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Verona</hi> had the charge of preſiding in the Congregation of Doctrine,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99003:158"/>and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto</hi> the other <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> in that of Reformation. Whilſt theſe things were carried on at <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope renewed his Inſtances with the <hi>Switzers</hi> to perſwade them to ſend their Divines to the Council, and the King of <hi>France</hi> diſſwaded them by his Ambaſſadour <hi>Morlay,</hi> wherein he ſucceeded, by the help and aſſiſtance of <hi>Vergerio</hi> who had formerly been the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and was then a Miniſter in the Countrey of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> And ſo neither Catholicks nor Proteſtants ſent to the Council, nay the <hi>Griſons</hi> recalled <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Plante</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coira,</hi> who was at <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the following Congregations the matters that had been propoſed were examined; the Order that had been made concerning the way of examination, and the trouble that they had put themſelves to to mark the Heads from whence the Proofs were to be taken, ſerved for no other end but to multiply diſcourſe, and render the diſputes more ridiculous. The School-way came ſtill in play, and becauſe at the ſame time they would obey the Regulation that ordered them to draw their Proofs from Scripture; the Divines puzled themſelves to find them out, but they applied the Texts in a ſenſe quite different from the true, and at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn put them to the Rack. For inſtance as to the point of Confeſſion, there was not a place in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> or any where elſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where the words <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> did occur, but what they interpreted in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Auricular Confeſſion; and this was the Head they laid greateſt ſtreſs upon. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Figures of the Old Teſtament were made
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99003:158"/>to authoriſe this Confeſſion; and a prodigious number of Miracles were alledged, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern, which has been wrought, either in favour of the Votaries of Confeſſion, or againſt thoſe that ſlighted it. In ſine, one may ſafely ſay, that the diſputes about this ſubject wanted both judgment and choice, and were ever now and then childiſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid. The diſputes being ended, the Decree which is to be ſeen in the Acts of the Council, was made: and that contained nine Chapters about Penance, and three concerning Extreme Unction. The firſt Chapter treats of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and inſtitution of the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; the ſecond, of the difference betwixt the Sacrament of Baptiſm and that of Penance; the third, of the parts and fruits of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; the fourth of Contrition; the fifth of Confeſſion; the ſixth of the Miniſter of that Sacrament; the ſeventh of Caſes reſerved; the eighth of the neceſſity and benefit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and the ninth of the works of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. As to Extreme Unction, the firſt Chapter ſpeaks of the inſtitution of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: the ſecond of its effect, and the third of the miniſter thereof. To theſe were added fifteen Canons as to the matter of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and four about Extreme Unction. They could not meet with the ſame good luck, nor uſe the ſame art about this matter, as they had found in the former Seſſions, that is,<note place="margin">Oppoſition of the Divines as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Penance, the Preſident takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</note> ſo to frame the Decrees and Canons as to ſatisfie all the different Parties, and make them find their own opinions in them. The Divines of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain</hi> oppoſed the Chapter and Canon which appointed a Reſervation of certain Caſes; as <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:99003:159"/>penſations ſhould be of no force. The Biſhops alſo complained that Titular Biſhops with a Privilege obtained from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> retired into Places out of the Biſhop's Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and there conferred Orders on all that demanded them, who could not have otherways obtained them becauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency. This was alſo prohibited, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the leaſt mention of the Pope who had granted thoſe Privileges. There was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great abuſe in the Exerciſe of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Juriſdiction, and that is, when a man was accuſed before the Biſhop's Tribunal, he appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and by means of money obtained a Judge at his own option, to whom Power was given to protect and defend him, and to put a ſtop to all Proſecutions againſt him: and this protection was extended even to the Domeſtick Servants of the Party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; thoſe Judges were called Conſervatours, and theſe Exemptions, Conſervatory Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, the Judges Conſervatours being many times the Biſhops Perſecutours. That abuſe was ſomewhat moderated, but not wholly extirpated; for it was indeed, enacted that notwithſtanding theſe Conſervatory Privileges a man might be ſued before the Ordinaries, eſpecially in criminal Caſes: but Univerſities, Colleges, Hoſpitals and Convents were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excepted. The Biſhops cried out migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily againſt that Exception, becauſe it was far more comprehenſive than the Rule. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be obtained, becauſe for the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope would have the Monks and Univerſities depend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on the holy See; and the Legate
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99003:159"/>received Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> not to yeild the leaſt in that point; ſo that the Party of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> being the more numerous, the reſt were fain to give way, and take good words for payment. It being a grievance that, contrary to the ancient Canons, Diſpenſations were granted to wilfull Murtherers to enter into holy Orders; that was prohibited in the ſeventh Chapter. There were alſo ſome other regulations made, againſt the various ways that Criminals took to avoid Epiſcopal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: againſt Biſhops who by Power from the Pope exerciſed Juriſdiction out of their Dioceſes: againſt the abuſe of annexing a Church in one Dioceſe, to another Church in another, which gave liberty to a Biſhop to exerciſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in the Dioceſe of another Biſhop; and in fine, againſt the abuſe of the Right of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. The ſpring-head of all theſe abuſes was the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ancient Canons being clearly againſt theſe Corruptions and bad Cuſtoms, but Diſpenſations evacuated the Force of Canons: the Biſhops were therefore for having it decreed that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not give Diſpenſations contrary to the Canons; but they could never obtain it. So that in the whole there was no diſorder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, becauſe the Legate, and the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s would by no means ſuffer the Pope to be named, nor that even the Names of the great Penitentiary and other Miniſters of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery ſhould enter into any of the Decrees. Now it is an undoubted Maxime amongſt the Canoniſts, that in all Laws wherein the Pope is not expreſly named, all that is enacted can be no way prejudicial to his Authority. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99003:160"/>that the Decrees deprived not the Pope of the Power of giving Diſpenſations in any Caſes, but ſerved onely to enhaunce the value of Diſpenſations, and to enrich the Chancery. The Monks made great inſtances for obtaining the abolition of <hi>Commendums;</hi> but it was thought ſufficient to ordain that Benefices which were not as yet in <hi>Commendum,</hi> when they came to be vacant, ſhould onely be given in Title, and to the Religious of the ſame Order; and thus the Number of <hi>Commendums</hi> was not leſſened, but care taken that they ſhould not encreaſe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the Duke of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> come to <hi>Trent,</hi> and cannot have Audience.</note>Whilſt theſe matters were on foot in the Congregations <hi>John Thierry Pleningher,</hi> and <hi>John Heclin</hi> Ambaſſadours of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> came to the Council. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to the Count of <hi>Montfort</hi> the Emperour's Ambaſſadour, that they might have Audience of the Council. The Count ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Legate with it, who told him that it was the Cuſtome of other Ambaſſadours to impart their Inſtructions to the Preſidents of the Council, and that theſe of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> ought to have done ſo; that they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to him, and that he would receive them with all imaginable Civility. The Ambaſſadours refuſed to doe that, becauſe one of the Articles which they had to demand was, that the Pope ſhould not preſide in the Council, and therefore they could not addreſs themſelves to his Legates as Preſidents. The Legate having received that anſwer, wrote immediately to <hi>Rome</hi> for inſtructions. It is eaſie to imagine what the inſtructions were; and indeed they had Orders not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99003:160"/>to abate a hair in that point, but to hazard all, and even to break up the Council accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Power they had, if they thought in neceſſary, rather than to ſuffer the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Authority of the holy See. About that time the Emperour came to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck,</hi> which is but a few days Journey from <hi>Trent,</hi> that he might obſerve the actions of the Council at a nearer diſtance. This gave the Pope ſome umbrage, who would have no other Maſter over the Council but himſelf; however he diſſembled his diſpleaſure.</p>

And this Seſſion in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Decrees is reckoned the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. Therein were publiſhed the Decrees and Canons which we have mentioned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Penance, Extreme Unction, and the Reformation in favour of Epiſcopal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Legate did what he could to hinder the Impreſſion of theſe Decrees, and indeed, they were not printed at <hi>Ripa</hi> where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe of the Council was; but they had Manuſcripts of them in <hi>Germany,</hi> which were quickly printed, and every one after the uſual manner, took the liberty to exerciſe their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in cenſuring of them.</p>
                  <p>Next day after the Seſſion, the Preſidents cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a General Congregation to adviſe about the matters that were to be handled in the following Seſſion; and the Points of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, and the Communion in both kinds were propoſed. In the following Congregations, after the points had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, four Chapters of Doctrines were made,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99003:161"/>and thirteen <hi>Anathema</hi>'s; but becauſe they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified nothing, and were not publiſhed, as will appear hereafter, it is to no purpoſe to reckon them up at length. In the Congregations that were held after Chriſtmaſs, they treated alſo of the Sacrament of Orders, concerning which twelve Articles, drawn out of the Books of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> were propoſed, and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conferences four Chapters of Doctrine, and eight Canons with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s paſt upon them; but neither were they publiſhed.

                     <note place="margin">The Council will not hear the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, though the Emperour had paſt his word that they ſhould.</note>The Ambaſſadours of the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> wrote to their Maſter, to give him an account of the Difficulties they met with, and to know what he intended they ſhould doe. He wrote back to them again that they ſhould manage the buſineſs as well as they could, but what e'er came on't that they ſhould find out a way to propoſe their Doctrine. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon applied themſelves to the Cardinal of <hi>Trent</hi> in the abſence of <hi>Count Montfort</hi> the Emperour's Ambaſſadour, and gave him a Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of their Commiſſion, which imported that they ſhould endeavour to obtain a Safe-conduct in ampler Form than that which had been given, and which ſhould in all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> that afterward they ſhould propoſe and defend their Doctrine. The Cardinal acquainted the Legate with this; who without any heſitation made anſwer, That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſhould not be heard, that Abſtracts of their Books ſhould be made as had been hitherto done, and that they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99003:161"/>ſhould proceed to Judgment thereupon; that if they humbly deſired inſtruction, it ſhould be given them; that he would not ſuffer an ace of this to be abated; and that for the matter of the Safe-conduct it was an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affront to the Council, not to truſt to their word. This was down right contrary to the Emperour's poſitive promiſe which he gave to the Proteſtants, that they ſhould be heard, and that they ſhould have all imaginable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. And therefore the Cardinal thought not fit to tell the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> that anſwer. He thought it enough to acquaint them that the Legate was angry that they ſhould offer to begin by propoſing their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as if they would give the Law to thoſe from whom they were to receive it, that they muſt have patience for ſome days till the Legate's anger was over, and begin with ſome other Article, but not that. The Emperour's Ambaſſadour moved the Legate alſo upon the ſame ſubject, but finding nothing to be done with him as to that particular, he deviſed ſeveral pretexts to amuſe the Proteſtant Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and to ſpin out the time, till he might fall upon ſome Expedient to ſave his Maſter's honour, who had ſo poſitively paſt his word, which was ſo little regarded by the Council. <hi>Stratsburg</hi> and five other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Towns ſent likewiſe their Ambaſſadours to <hi>Trent,</hi> who were ſtopt by the ſame Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. So the Emperour's Ambaſſadour gave advice to his Maſter that the Council would not hear the Proteſtants, contrary to the promiſe that he had made them: whereupon the Emperour ſent him Orders that he ſhould
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99003:162"/>ſtop the Proteſtant Ambaſſadours and make them ſtay a little; that the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Saxony</hi> were ſpeedily to be at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and that he would adviſe with them about means to procure them ſatisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> About the ſame time <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> paſt through <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants made their grievances known to him; he exhorted them to patience, and promiſed them to treat with the Emperour his Uncle, that what he had aſſured them of ſhould be accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>The Pope who knew very well that there was a conſiderable party forming againſt him, and did not think the Cardinals ſo true to his cauſe, becauſe all of them had already eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the intereſts of foreign Princes, at Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs 1551, at one daſh created fourteen Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals all <hi>Italians:</hi> he named thirteen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the fourteenth <hi>in petto,</hi> and that was the Biſhop of <hi>Siponto</hi> one of his <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s at the Council.</p>
                  <p>And now, from all parts nothing was heard but Rumours of War, Soldiers were raiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral Pretexts throughout all <hi>Germany.</hi> The Proteſtant Princes who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to promiſe that they would ſubmit to the Council, beſtirred themſelves to get looſe from their Engagement. The Emperour had likewiſe exerciſed in all places great Severities to oblige the Princes and Towns, to receive the <hi>interim:</hi> all <hi>Germany</hi> groaned under the Yoke of <hi>Charles</hi> his Power, and longed to ſhake it off. On the other ſide the King of <hi>France</hi> fomented the Diviſions; ſo that a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtorm began to gather, and the Fathers
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99003:162"/>of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> took the Alarm; though the Emperour endeavoured what he could to encourage them; he told them that the Ambaſſadours of the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> of whom the greateſt talk was, were then with him at <hi>Inſpruck</hi> on their way to <hi>Trent,</hi> and that he would omit nothing that might contribute to the ſecurity of the Council.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> come to the Council, and ſpeak higher than the reſt.</note>The ſeventh of <hi>January</hi> the Ambaſſadours of the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> arrived at the Council. <hi>Maurice</hi> their Maſter had not the leaſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſubmit to it, but that he might lull the Emperour aſleep whilſt he was cutting out work for him, he ſent his Ambaſſadours to <hi>Trent,</hi> who were <hi>Wolf Coller,</hi> and <hi>Leonard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dehorn.</hi> Theſe Ambaſſadours ſpoke in a higher ſtrain than the reſt, as well knowing that their Maſter would quickly be in a condition to make the beſt of them afraid of him. They had Conference with the Emperour's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and declared to them that their Maſter expected a Safe-conduct in the form of that of <hi>Baſil.</hi> They demanded that a ſtop might be made to all proceedings in Council untill the arrival of the Proteſtant Divines, who were but forty Leagues off, waiting onely for a Safe-conduct; that the Decrees which had paſt, ſhould be examined again anew; that the Pope ſhould not preſide in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; that the Votes ſhould be free, and that the Biſhops ſhould be abſolved from their Oath to the Pope. Afterwards the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours made their Complements to the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and to the Cardinal of <hi>Trent,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed every thing with them; but they would have no Conference with the Legate,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99003:163"/>becauſe they refuſed to acknowledge him for Preſident of the Council. The Emperour's Ambaſſadours according to their Orders uſed thoſe of <hi>Saxony</hi> very civilly, becauſe they began to have ſome Apprehenſions of their Maſter; but the Legate obſerved no meaſures with them, no more than they did with him. He made anſwer that they ſhould have no other Safe-conduct; that the Council ſhould give publick audience to theſe Ambaſſadours, and the other Proteſtants, ſeeing it had been promiſed them by the Emperour; but that firſt of all they muſt own the Legate and <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>'s for lawfull Preſidents, and that for the other demands, that the Pope ſhould not preſide in the Council, and that the Biſhops ſhould be freed from the Oath of Fidelity, that they had taken to him; they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and bordered ſo near upon blaſphemy, that they would ſooner loſe their Lives than ſuffer any ſuch thing; rather diſſolve the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and uſe the utmoſt rigours. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who perceived that this Conduct tended to an irreparable breach, and that that would give a lawfull Pretext to the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> to provide for his own Security by way of Arms, gave Orders to his Ambaſſadours, and to the Cardinal of <hi>Trent</hi> to Employ both En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and the Threats of the Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to bring the Legate to a milder way of anſwering. They ſo handled the matter that at length the Legate abated ſomewhat of his height. He condeſcended to give the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours an audience in a General Congregation to be held in his Palace, that all the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Council ſhould be ſuperſeded, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99003:163"/>as to the buſineſs of the Safe-conduct, it ſhould be referred to the pleaſure of the Fathers. A Congregation was thereupon held, wherein the point of ſuperſeding the proceedings of the Council, paſt without difficulty: but the matter of the Safe-conduct ſuffered more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; but in fine, the Authority of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, of the three Electours, and Cardinal of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo far prevailed, that they reſolved to grant them one in ampler form. The like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſolved to give the Proteſtant Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours an audience in a General Congregation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But here, <hi>Peter Taillevoy</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Paler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> ſtarted a difficulty about the place of the Ambaſſadours to whom they were to give Audience. He ſaid that if they were treated according to their Character of Hereticks, the Council could give them no place of honour, and that they muſt hear them as Criminals; but that in ſo doing all would be loſt, becauſe they would not endure to be heard as Delinquents, but would immediately withdraw; and on the other ſide, if they did otherways, it would prove a prejudice to the Church. To get out of this ſtrait it was reſolved, according to the overture propoſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Namburg,</hi> that they ſhould give the Proteſtants places of honour, making firſt a Proteſtation that it was done out of Charity and Compaſſion, which are motives above the Law. The four and twentieth of <hi>January</hi> was therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the General Congregation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Audience was to be given to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Saxony:</hi> and the Council named de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties who with the Biſhop of <hi>Siponto</hi> one of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s were to draw up the Safe-conduct.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99003:164"/>The Emperour's Ambaſſadours deſired to have the minute of it, that they might communicate the ſame to the Proteſtants, and that it might be altered, if need were, before it ſhould be publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>A rough draught of the Safe-conduct being drawn, and given to the Emperour's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, they ſent for the Proteſtants, made them a long Speech in praiſe of the Fathers of the Council, whoſe goodneſs, clemency, and condeſcenſion ſo much appeared by what they granted in their favour, telling them that on the other hand, they ought to ſubmit and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it prudently. That as to the demand they made that the Pope ſhould ſubmit to the Council, it ought to be propoſed with great circumſpection, that the Divines were to be expected, and that they themſelves had great matters to propoſe as to that particular on the Emperour's part, ſo ſoon as the Overture ſhould be made by the Proteſtants; that the Fathers of the Council themſelves were very ſenſible, that the greatneſs of the Pope ought to be leſſened: but that it ought to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout warily, and not in that brisk manner as the Proteſtants deſigned. In fine, they ſhew'd them the Safe-conduct, which did not pleaſe them; becauſe it was not in the form of that of <hi>Baſil:</hi> which had granted the <hi>Bohemians</hi> four things that they alſo demanded.

                     </list> And laſtly, that nothing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99003:164"/>ſhould be done to diſgrace and reproach their Doctrine; they found fault likewiſe that the Council gave no ſecurity in name of the Pope, and of the College of Cardinals, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil</hi> had done. The Emperour's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours were angry that they were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Safe-conduct, which they had with ſo much trouble obtained: but they could not move the Proteſtants to yield, ſo that they promiſed to make a Report of the matter in the next Congregation. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they did, but the Preſidents and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ſtood firm to their reſolution not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing in the Safe-conduct, ſaying that it was falſe that the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> had granted the Deputies of <hi>Bohemia</hi> a deciſive Vote; that as to the Exerciſe of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Houſes, it was ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Safe-conduct, ſeeing it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; and that as to the fourth point, that nothing ſhould be done to the Contempt of their Doctrine, care enough was taken as to that by the Terms of the Safe-conduct; in a word they alledged that it was as ample as that of the Council of <hi>Baſil.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Montfort</hi> made a motion thereupon, that to take from the Proteſtants all occaſion of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing, they ſhould copy the Safe-conduct of <hi>Baſil</hi> word for word, onely changing the Names. That Propoſal broke the Preſidents meaſures, they lookt at one another, as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what to ſay; till the Legate hit upon a ready expedient of referring the matter to the next Congregation. That was a fetch of a man of parts, for by this means the Preſidents had time to ſolicite the Biſhops vigorouſly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99003:165"/>the cauſe of God, for ſo they called the intereſt of the Pope, againſt the attempts of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which the Pope and his Adherents did ſo deteſt, that they would not imitate any thing that had been done there. The Preſidents of the Council obtained what they deſired, and there was nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Safe-conduct. At length the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was held the four and twentieth of <hi>January</hi> for giving audience to the Proteſtants. At the opening of it the Legate made a ſpeech, wherein he laid before them the importance of the affair that they were going to enter upon: and the Proteſtation that was framed upon occaſion of the difficulty ſtarted by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Palermo</hi> concerning the places of the Proteſtant Ambaſſadours, being read, and ordered to be inſerted into the Acts, the Ambaſſadours were introduced. <hi>Badehorn,</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> bowing to the Prelates, called them <hi>Reverendiſſimi &amp; ampliſſimi Patres;</hi>

The Proteſtant Princes and all the reſt of the ſame Party, were expreſly named in it, and all ſecurity given them for coming to <hi>Trent,</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and returning back; they had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er allowed them to puniſh thoſe of their Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues as ſhould commit any inſolency at <hi>Trent,</hi> or on the rode. And if any ſhould happen to doe them injury, the Council promiſed them all the Juſtice that they themſelves ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. In fine, in caſe they ſhould be obliged to withdraw from the Council, they ſhould have twenty days allowed them to betake themſelves to places of Safety. At the ſame time the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent new inſtructions to the Preſidents to haſten as much as they could the concluſion of the Council. And therefore during the intermiſſion which had been granted to the Proteſtants, the Legate
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99003:166"/>and <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s cauſed matters to be prepared for the following Seſſions, thinking that in two or three Seſſions more, they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſpatch what remained to be done.</p>
                  <p>The Pope was well informed of what had paſt at <hi>Trent</hi> betwixt the Emperour's Miniſters and the Proteſtant Ambaſſadours, and how that they had in ſome meaſure given mutual promiſes to endeavour the diminution of the Papal Authority; he knew likewiſe that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates had much ſuch another deſign; ſo that beginning now to apprehend the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and <hi>Germans,</hi> he reſolved to truſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour no longer, but to ſtrike in with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and negotiated his treaty with <hi>Tournon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants after the Seſſion made a great buſtle, becauſe nothing had been altered in the Safe-conduct; but the Emperour's Ambaſſadours told them that upon the main all that they demanded was in it, that all they ſtood upon was onely the form, which was not worth the minding; though theſe reaſons did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, yet they accepted the Safe-conduct, but onely that they might ſend it to their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In the mean time, the Preſidents that they might haſten on the diſſolution of the Council, as it had been ordered at <hi>Rome,</hi> held a General Congregation to frame Articles upon the Subject of Marriage, and in the following Congregations they proceeded ſo far as to frame Canons. The Proteſtants hereupon made a great noiſe, ſaying that they were made fools of, ſince contrary to the word that was given them, new Deciſions were daily made: that when they had demanded a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99003:166"/>it was not barely a forbearance of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were but Ceremonies, but of all Synodal proceedings. The Emperour's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſeconded them, and endeavoured to obtain an intermiſſion of all action, which the Preſidents refuſed. But the Emperour ſent an Agent to <hi>Trent</hi> to prevail with the Council to ſuperſede giving him Orders to goe to <hi>Rome;</hi> if he could obtain nothing at <hi>Trent,</hi> and to advance even to a Proteſtation againſt all that ſhould be done; that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, wherewith the Council was threatned, put a ſtop to the Congregations, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was taken of forbearing all Synodal proceedings, till ſuch time as the Council ſhould think otherways. The Pope was fain to conſent to this whether he would or not, and that incenſed him the more againſt the Emperour. He wrote to <hi>Trent</hi> that that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance ſhould not be extended beyond a few days, and that afterward they ſhould fall again to action without any fear of danger.</p>
                  <p>To employ the Council, who in this time of intermiſſion had nothing to doe, they held Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions during the Lent at <hi>Trent,</hi> as at <hi>Rome</hi> they did in the beginning of <hi>March.</hi> The Miniſters of <hi>Saxony</hi> received Letters from their Maſter, who to amuſe the Emperour wrote to them that they ſhould make freſh inſtances to the Council, for obtaining what they had deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, giving them to underſtand that within a few days he was to goe wait on the Emperour, to adviſe with him about the beſt means for carrying on their common deſigns. However this did not prevent a rumour that was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpread abroad of a League between the King
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99003:167"/>of <hi>France</hi> and the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> againſt the Emperour. And upon this Rumour the Electours of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Mentz</hi> parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> and paſt through <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> where they had long and ſecret Conferences with the Emperour. The Ambaſſadours of <hi>Saxony</hi> not thinking themſelves ſafe enough at <hi>Trent</hi> parted from thence likewiſe about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and returned home by different ways. Nevertheleſs the Proteſtant Divines under the Protection of their Safe-conducts came to <hi>Trent,</hi> four from <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and two from <hi>Stratsbourg.</hi> And now the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>March</hi> the day prefixed for holding the Seſſion drawing near; the Preſidents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Seſſion called a General Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that day, wherein it was concluded that they ſhould not too haſtily give an anſwer to the inſtances which the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> ſued for; and therefore they proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued the Seſſion to the firſt of <hi>May.</hi> At the ſame time the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugal</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and made and received the uſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements in that Congregation. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants preſſed daily for an anſwer, and that the Council would fall to their proceedings again, becauſe their Divines were come; but the Preſidents waved all their inſtances: ſo that in a few days the countenance of affairs was much altered; but a little while before they would not defer any thing in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Proteſtants; and now they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proceed to buſineſs, though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants earneſtly urged it. The truth is, they would have very willingly continued the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodal proceedings; but they durſt not, becauſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99003:167"/>they had no mind to hear the Proteſtants nor to give them any anſwer, as had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; and therefore they daily found out ſome new reaſon for delay. At length they had a very plauſible pretext, which was the ſickneſs of the Legate <hi>Marcello Creſcentio</hi> who on the five and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ill by a ſtrange Accident. He had been buſie all day till night in diſpatching Letters for <hi>Rome,</hi> and riſing from his ſeat to take a little breath, he thought he ſaw a prodigious great black Dog with flaming Eyes, and long hanging Ears coming ſtreight towards him, which afterwards diſappeared under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This put him into a great fright; but being come to himſelf again a little, he called his Servants who were in the Antichamber, and bid them beat out that black Dog; but the Dog not being found, the fright caſt him into a fit of ſickneſs of which he never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; his ſickneſs ſerved for a good pretext for the delays that were made in anſwering the Proteſtants: And beſides, no ſooner was one difficulty removed, but the Pope's Agents ſtarted another, becauſe they were no leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the Emperour and Imperialiſts, than they were of the Proteſtants, and they waited onely for a favourable occaſion of breaking up the Council, which ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. The <hi>German</hi> Biſhops were already gone upon the Rumour of a War,<note place="margin">

But whilſt he thus played his game with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Albert</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> went ſecretly into <hi>France</hi> and made a Treaty with <hi>Henry</hi> the II. of <hi>France. Maurice</hi> in the mean while, about the beginning of the Spring brought into the Field the men whom he had raiſed during the Winter; and then publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> addreſſed to all the States of the Empire, wherein he remonſtrated that he had been amuſed with vain hopes of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that notwithſtanding ſevereſt rigours were uſed againſt the Proteſtants, particularly in baniſhing the Miniſters of the Goſpel.

At that time the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> judged it a matter of higheſt importance to doe any thing that might give ground to imagine that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and its Decrees had any Power and Force, but what they derived from the Authority of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour now at laſt received great blows all of a ſudden.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99003:169"/>thoſe great Dignities and Territories which he had united in his own Perſon. It is true, that he could not hinder his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from ſucceeding to him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſeeing he was already King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Nevertheleſs ſome Hiſtorians do ſay, that he had deſired of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> a reſignation of the Dignity of King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Son <hi>Philip;</hi> but that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had well thought on't, would not make that reſignation.

                  <p>THE Pope finding himſelf eaſed of a Burthen that had lain heavy upon him, by the breaking up of the Council, reſolved with himſelf to keep out of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,<note place="margin">The Pope has enough of Councils, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the Emperour care for them.</note> and not to run into ſuch ſtraits again. Nevertheleſs to perſwade the world that he was concerned at that Rupture, or rather to convince them what a uſeleſs thing a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was, he himſelf undertook the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; and for that end appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a numerous Congregation of Cardinals; but this, as all the other deſigns of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſently vaniſhed; it produced nothing but a great many Debates; ſo that within a few Months it was wholly laid aſide. Nor was there any more talk of reaſſembling the Council, which was at this time interrupted
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99003:171"/>for almoſt ten Years. <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who had been the great ſtickler for the Convocation of the Council, had not now the ſame inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to prompt him; his main deſign was the greatneſs of his Family, and he had made it his buſineſs to render the Empire hereditary, as the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> and his other Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were. He thought to have accompliſhed his ends by depreſſing the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the Pope, and that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was the fitteſt inſtrument for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And, indeed, this Emperour had got ſo great an Aſcendant over the minds of all of his Family, that he could perſwade them to any thing, even contrary to their own intereſts; his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by conſequence apparent Emperour: and he had prevailed with him that the Empire ſhould be ſhared betwixt him and his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> as the <hi>Antonins</hi> had done heretofore. <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> their Siſter who was wholly at <hi>Charles</hi> his Devotion for reaſons, perhaps, not fit to be named, had perſwaded <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to admit of that partnerſhip; but <hi>Maximilian, Ferdinand</hi>'s Son, perceiving that by that deſign he was like to be fruſtrated of the hopes of ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Father in the Empire, defeated all the intrigues. So that the Proſpects of <hi>Charles</hi> being at an end with his hopes; the Council was no more in his thoughts, and <hi>Julius</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red far leſs for it than he. It is true, the Rupture of the Council, and the peace of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> had quite exſtinguiſhed the Pope's hopes of ever ſeeing the revolted <hi>Germans</hi> reduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the obedience of the holy See. But
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99003:171"/>to comfort himſelf for the loſs of the <hi>Germans,</hi> he drew from a remote Corner of the World, I know not what, a kind of ſubjects who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the Authority of his See.<note place="margin">

The confirmation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Henry</hi> was a great ſtep towards an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Catharine</hi> could not be declared lawfull, without admitting the Diſpenſation of <hi>Julius</hi> II. who had diſpenſed with <hi>Henry</hi> to Marry his Brother's Widow. So that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by that procedure owned that the Pope has Power to diſpence with the Laws of God, and by conſequence acknowledged him Head of the Church. A motion was made of Marrying the Queen who was already forty years old, and three Matches were propoſed; Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> who was of the Bloud Royal; the Lord <hi>Courtenay</hi> Cozin to <hi>Henry</hi> VIII and <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain.

The Cardinal complained of this, as of an action that did violate the Majeſty of the holy See, and an
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99003:173"/>affront done to the Pope and his Legates: So that <hi>Charles</hi> having detained him ſometime, was forced to give him his liberty, and ſent him to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> But he found a means to amuſe him in <hi>Brabant,</hi> under colour of engaging him in a negotiation of Peace betwixt the King of <hi>France</hi> and himſelf, untill the Marriage was accompliſhed. In the beginning of the year, 1554. The Emperour ſent four Ambaſſadours into <hi>England</hi> for concluding the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> his Son and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Mary,</hi> in the mean while, who with much prudence went gradually on in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of Religion, made new Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; reſtored the uſe of the Latin Tongue in Divine Service, renounced the Supremacy in the Church, gave it back to the Pope, and ſo annulled the Acts of her Father. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was brought before the Parliament; where it met with oppoſition amongſt the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Church Lands poſſeſſed by the Nobles, which they muſt be obliged to give back again. So that the Pope's Supremacy paſt not at that time. Prince <hi>Philip</hi> that he might not ſeem inferiour to <hi>Mary</hi> in Dignity, took the Title of King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his Marriage at <hi>London</hi> the twenty fifth of <hi>July,</hi> being St. <hi>James</hi> his day the Patron of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Parliament met again in the month of <hi>November</hi> following, and Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> was therein reſtored to all his rights and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

The Queen cauſed a Petition to be framed wherein the Parliament begg'd Pardon of the Pope, for having withdrawn themſelves from under his obedience. This Petition was preſented to the King and Queen, who riſing immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their Chairs of State, went to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and beſought him to grant the Parliament the Pardon which they begg'd.

So ſoon as he was exalted to the Pontifical Chair, he laid a deſign of calling the Council again for ſetling the affairs of Religion, and that the Council might be happy in its proceedings, he thought it his own duty to begin with a thorough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Clergy and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had been often propoſed by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours; but never heartily meant by moſt of them.

As he was a man who had always affected a great auſterity of life, and was beſides haughty to the higheſt degree, ſo it was feared that if once he ſet upon a deſign of Reforming the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he would bring it about, what ever came on't: but they were ſoon rid of all theſe fears, for he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid aſide that affected ſeverity of life.

Never was there Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> that carried it with greater Pomp and Grandure. The Steward of his houſe having asked him how he intended to be ſerved for the future; like a great Prince, anſwered he. He would be crowned with greater Pomp than any of his Predeceſſours, and affected never to appear abroad but in great State and Splendour. The Engliſh Ambaſſadours who came to render homage to the holy See, arrived juſt upon the day of his Exaltation, which he took as a good preſage. The Ambaſſadours falling down at his feet begg'd pardon for the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: The Pope took them up, granted them what they deſired, and without being ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, erected <hi>Ireland</hi> into a Kingdom in favour of the King and Queen. This was a very ſurprizing Act, and no body underſtood the myſtery of it, nor could any imagine what he drove at, in giving the name of Kingdom to an Iſland which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly poſſeſt under that Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that was a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99003:176"/>fetch of <hi>Roman</hi> Policy: <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. after his ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had erected <hi>Ireland</hi> into a Kingdom, and had left it to <hi>Edward</hi> under that Title. Now the Pope pretending to have the onely right of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Crowns, and erecting States into King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, had a deſign to oblige Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to quit the Title of Queen of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving very well that that would prove too hard a task, he thought it better without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, and as being ignorant of what <hi>Henry</hi> had done, to erect that Countrey into a Kingdom, that ſo <hi>Mary</hi> might enjoy the Title of it, as holding it of the Pope, and not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it from her Father. Moreover, with an imperious Air and full of Authority he told the Ambaſſadours, that the Revenues and Church Lands muſt forthwith be reſtored to the Clergy, and the Tribute of St. <hi>Peter</hi> be ſetled again as formerly. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to give the Pope ſatisfaction as to that, but ſhe could not prevail; becauſe moſt of the great men of the Nation were in actual and hereditary poſſeſſion of the Revenues of the Church, and could not be brought to part from them.

The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants moved that it might be permitted to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Abbots to change their Religion without loſing their Dignities and Revenues, but that did not paſs. The Catholicks on the other hand, urged that thoſe States which had accepted the <hi>Interim</hi> ſome ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould not have the liberty of returning again to the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> but at length they yielded, and ſo all the States en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed full liberty of Conſcience; nay, and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were maintained in the poſſeſſion of the Church-Revenues, which they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy allotted for the entertainment of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Schools. Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> the moſt haughty and paſſionate man living, fell into a furious rage againſt this Edict of Liberty. He publickly threatned the Emperour and <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he would make them repent the injury they had done to the holy See. He exhorted them to recall thoſe Edicts, wherein if they failed, he threatned to proceed againſt them with as ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as he intended to uſe againſt the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> he ſaid that all the misfortunes that had befallen <hi>Charles,</hi> proceeded from the wrath of God againſt him, becauſe of his indifference, and that he had not vigorouſly beſtirred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reducing <hi>Germany</hi> to the obedience of the holy See, which he might have done. In this manner, and with ſuch kind of Diſcourſe he entertained the Emperour's Ambaſſadour, and the Cardinal of <hi>Ausbourg.</hi> He obſerved the ſame Character with all other Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours; telling them often that he was above all Princes, that he expected not that any of

As for the Pope he ſtood it out merely by his haughtineſs, and did not think he ſtood in need of other Arms, than thoſe which the Character of Pope put into his hands; he perſwaded himſelf that by his Spiritual Weapons he could doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pleaſed, for never man valued himſelf more upon the account of Fortune than he, becauſe all things had ever ſucceeded with him. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing he entertained vaſt thoughts and aimed at all, he eaſily let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be perſwaded, that he ought to make uſe of all. Inſomuch, that if on the one hand the Uncle was inclineable enough of himſelf to employ the Power of the Church with utmoſt rigour, the Nephew on the other hand, put it in his head to fortifie the Spiritual Power by Temporal Arms, and the Pope conſented to it; but he would have that Union of the Arms of the World with thoſe of the Church to be made very ſecretly, and not to appear
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99003:177"/>ſooner than was neceſſary. He therefore trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very ſecretly with the King of <hi>France</hi> to take the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to transfer it to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> on condition that a good part of it ſhould be annexed to the Eccleſiaſtick State.

                  </p>
                  <p>For the carrying on theſe great deſigns the Pope reſolved to create a great number of Cardinals, who might depend on him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Creatures. Upon his Elevation he had taken an Oath to make but a few Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, becauſe the Sacred College was already too numerous. So ſoon as mention was made of this promotion ſo contrary to what he had promiſed, and ſo oppoſite to the Emperour's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to whom the Pope intended to raiſe as many Enemies as he made Cardinals, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred College and eſpecially the Imperialiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to oppoſe it. The Pope had notice of that, called a Conſiſtory on the twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> and ſo ſoon as he had taken his place, he told them that he would grant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to none, that he himſelf would onely ſpeak, that he had weighty matters to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that none muſt interrupt him: The Cardinal of St. <hi>Jago</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> riſing to ſpeak to him, he puncht him ſeveral times on the breaſt and thruſt him back. When all were ſet down after this Preface, he complained of the rumours that were ſpread abroad, that he could not lawfully create more than four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals becauſe of the Oath that had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from him at his Inauguration. He told
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99003:178"/>them, that he would have them know that the Pope could not be bound by any Engagement, nor by any Man, nor indeed bind himſelf by any Oath; that to think the contrary was Hereſie, from which out of Favour and Grace he abſolved thoſe who by ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had incurred the penalties due to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, becauſe he was willing to believe that they were not obſtinately engaged in it; but that if any one perſiſted to think or ſpeak ſo, he would put him in the Inquiſition; telling them plainly that he would make Cardinals, and that he would not be contradicted. He named ſeven, one of whom, to wit, <hi>Gropper</hi> a Divine of <hi>Cologne,</hi> refuſed the Hat.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who till then would not take the orders of Prieſthood, was made Prieſt, and four Months after, Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the place of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> who was burnt. In <hi>Germany</hi> the People of <hi>Auſtria</hi> demanded of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Liberty of Conſcience; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> refuſed it under pretext that he was bound by Oath to the Church, nevertheleſs he granted them the Cup con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally untill the next Council, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited them to endeavour any change in the reſt of the Ceremonies. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> made alſo the ſame prohibition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Territories, and allowed the Cup to his People. But the Palatinate was wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: for the Electour being dead, his Nephew ſucceeded him, and ſo ſoon as he was fixt, he forbid the Maſs, and the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion within his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>

                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:99003:178"/>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> who omitted nothing that might make for his Reputation, and confirm his Authority, undertook to reform the Church, and for that end eſtabliſhed a great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation compoſed of an hundred and fifty Perſons,<note place="margin">The Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church, but that propoſal had no ſucceſs.</note> which he divided into three Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; he aſſigned them firſt, the matter of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be examined; but that is a nice point, it is the Spring-head of all the Wealth of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some were for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in cutting off all manner of ways, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by money is taken for ſpiritual things. The Pope himſelf ſeemed to favour that opinion ſo far, that he ſaid he would not grant any Matrimonial Diſpenſations; but the heat of that Zeal laſted not long, for the oppoſition was ſo great, and the Difficulties ſo terrible, that all was laid aſide; ſome propoſed to him the Calling of the Council again for carrying on of that Reformation, and, indeed, at his Inauguration he had ſworn ſo to doe: but he laughed at that, ſaying that he had nothing to doe with a Council, that he was above thoſe things, and that it was a great ſillineſs to have ſent twice already threeſcore Biſhops and forty Divines the weakeſt of all the Mountaineers, to determine Controverſies of the higheſt Nature: as if theſe good Folks had had more knowledge and capacity than the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> adding notwithſtanding, that provided the Council were held at <hi>Rome,</hi> he would not be againſt it. But eſpecially when he came to know what toleration King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had granted their Subjects to communicate under both kinds, he took the Alarm and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99003:179"/>looked upon that action as an attempt, hardly to be remedied without a Council. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent to Complement him upon his exaltation,<note place="margin">The Pope falls into a rage upon occaſion of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands made to him by the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Poland.</hi>

The firſt was, that they might have liberty to celebrate Maſs in the Vulgar Tongue; the ſecond, that the Communion might be adminiſtred under both kinds; the third, that Prieſts might be allowed to <hi>Mary;</hi> and the fourth, that they might pay no more <hi>Annats,</hi> and that a national Synod might be called in <hi>Poland,</hi> for adjuſting the Differences about Religion. He broke forth into a rage, when the Propoſals were made to him, and all theſe things concurring together made him reſolve to call a Council at <hi>Rome.</hi> He orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Ambaſſadours to acquaint their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that he intended to celebrate a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and declared the ſame in a Congregation of Cardinals. On his Coronation-day being the ſix and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> a great many Cardinals with the Ambaſſadours of Princes being with him at Table, he ſaid that he had acquainted Princes with his deſign merely out of form and civility; that he would make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what the Holy See can doe, when it is poſſeſt by a reſolute and couragious Pope; that he well foreſaw that his Propoſal would diſpleaſe them becauſe of the Place that he had pitcht upon, but that though they ſhould not ſend one Prelate to his Council, he would not be much concerned, and that he well knew how far his Authority reached.</p>

But he could not forgive Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> to whom he owed ſo great obligations, for having reduced <hi>England</hi> to the obedience of the Holy See; for he ſought a pretext to break with him, he deprived him of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateſhip, and put into the Inquiſition his Friend <hi>Thomas de S.

But inſtead of endeavouring to make peace, <hi>Caraffa</hi> his Legate in <hi>France</hi> perſwaded the King to break the Truce; and offered him abſolution from his Oath. The Princes of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſolicited him to that action, but the reſt of the Court looked upon that perfidiouſneſs with abhorrence. There was onely one thing that ſtuck with <hi>Henry</hi> II. and that was that the Pope being extremely old, he could not hold out long; that after him another would come, who might take other meaſures; and that ſo he would be left alone in the mire into which the Pope had plung'd him. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> a man for expedients, found out one preſently: he told the King that he muſt get the Pope to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99003:180"/>create ſo many Cardinals of the <hi>French</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the King might always be ſure of having in the holy See a man at his Devotion. This was a croſs ill laid trap, however <hi>Henry</hi> was caught in it, and did whatſoever they would have him doe. But theſe Negotiations could not be kept ſo ſecret, but that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour began to ſuſpect that the work that was preparing for him was of the Pope's cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out; for the Legate that was ſent to him made but very ſmall Journeys, and when he came to <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> he had orders from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi> to come into <hi>France,</hi> to ſtop there; and not to goe to the Emperour, though he was but two days Journey from him.</p>

About the ſame time another thing happened which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed the Pope in trouble; and that was that in the Diet of <hi>Ausbourg</hi> the Acts of the laſt Years Conference, which ended without any Succeſs, having been examined, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour confirmed the Liberty of Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Pacification at <hi>Paſſau,</hi> and the Receſſes of the Diets which had been held afterward. The Pope could not hinder, nor oppoſe it by his Legates; for he had excluded himſelf from all Negotiation with <hi>Germany</hi> by the affront and injury he had done to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</hi> And to mortifie him for good and all, peace was concluded at <hi>Cambray,</hi> the third of <hi>April,</hi> betwixt the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> So that he found himſelf left alone, forſaken of all men, hated of thoſe two Princes, betwixt whom he had kindled a War, inſtead of quenching it, as it was the Duty of the Common Father of the Church. In that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the two Kings obliged themſelves mutually to endeavour the Reformation of the Church, and the Calling of a Council for rooting out of Hereſies. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> were both great Perſecutours of Proteſtants: eſpecially <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who thought it not enough to uſe Fire and Sword in a moſt cruel manner within his own Dominions; but ſent Ambaſſadours to all Neighbouring Princes to ſolicite them to take the ſame violent Courſes againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. Perhaps there was more of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and revenge than Zeal for Religion in this Conduct; for he had a mortal hatred to the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> becauſe they had
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99003:182"/>been the Cauſe that he was not named King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Diet of <hi>Ausbourg</hi> in the Year 1551. for the reformed States favoured <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Son who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Election of <hi>Philip.</hi> From the time of the firſt Edict of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, there had been above fifty thouſand men put to death by moſt cruel Torments in the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; but this being not ſufficient to <hi>Philip,</hi> he made a League with <hi>France</hi> for the total Subverſion of the Reformation. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Granvel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> were the great ſticklers for that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
                  <p>For putting of this deſign in execution, <hi>Philip</hi> had a great mind to have brought the Inquiſition into the low Countreys; but his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the V. having heretofore ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo ill in that deſign, that he was forced to leave it off, he feared that that Enterpriſe might coſt him more trouble than it had done his Father. To cut off ſome of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that might happen he reſolved to begin with the multiplication of Biſhopricks, in hopes that theſe Biſhops might contribute much to the accompliſhment of his deſign. There were but two Biſhopricks in all the low Countreys, <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> all the reſt of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were under the Juriſdiction of <hi>German</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, and theſe two Biſhops were alſo Suffragans to Strangers. <hi>Philip</hi> drew his Territories from under a foreign ſpiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and erected into Biſhopricks, <hi>Namur, Antwerp, Baliſe-duc, Ghent, Bruges, Ipres,</hi> St. <hi>Omer, Harlem, Midleburg, Leuvarden, Gronin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, Ruremonde</hi> and <hi>Deventer,</hi> and eſtabliſhed
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99003:183"/>three Archbiſhopricks, <hi>Cambray, Malines</hi> and <hi>Utrecht.</hi> The People perceived very well what that tended to: and therefore they grew more obſtinate, and became inclinable to embrace the Reformation, refuſing to pay any Taxes till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers were removed. <hi>Henry</hi> II. on his part did all that lay in his power to ruine the Proteſtants in his Kingdom. He reſolved to be preſent at the famous <hi>Mercurial</hi> which was held the fifteenth of <hi>June,</hi> this was the name that was given to the Aſſemblies which met on <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> for examining and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the manners of the Judges of Parliament. Matters of Religion were to be treated of there, and the King would hear the Judges argue that affair, that he himſelf might know who were infected with new opinions.

The Proteſtants, in the mean while, encreaſed amidſt all theſe Perſecutions, and that made the King's Council look out for other means of compoſing the troubles, than what had been employed hitherto: it was concluded that a Council of the whole Nation muſt be called; but Cardinal <hi>d' Armagnac</hi> who was wholly for the intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was as good as any Inquiſitor againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, withſtood that reſolution. <hi>Monluc</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> was of opinion for calling a

As to the matter of the Council, they were ſtedfaſt in their deſign, of calling a national one in <hi>France,</hi> giving the Pope, in the mean time, aſſurance that nothing ſhould be attempted in it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Authority. But he could not truſt too much to that, he was very apprehenſive of the <hi>French</hi> Prelates, who were accuſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Hereſie, and were at leaſt prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with ſome Tenets which they call the Privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and with Maximes that ſute not with that Supremacy which is challenged by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The apprehenſion of this made the Pope ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reſolve to call the General Council:<note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to call a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> But he was at a ſtand as to the place, he would have been very willing to have held it at <hi>Bologna,</hi> but he did not expect that the Prelates would come thither. <hi>Milan</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, but he would not accept of it, unleſs the Citadel were put into his hands during the ſitting of the Council.

He himſelf wrote to his <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s in all places, that they ſhould exhort the Princes to have their Arms in readineſs to conſtrain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to return into the boſome of the Church, for it was not ſo much his thought to hold a Council for deciding of Controverſies, as to take from Princes all pretext of dealing with Proteſtants in the way of Lenity and Mildneſs. The opinions of the Princes were extremely divided as to that particular. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> approved both the Council, and the choice of the place, but the <hi>French</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> and propoſed <hi>Treves, Conſtance, Wormes,</hi> or <hi>Haguenau.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was of the ſame mind, affirming that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did abominate the Council which was begun, that it would be impoſſible ever to induce them to come, or to ſubmit to the Council, if a new one were not called. He added that he could not undertake for the Empire, before he had aſſembled a General Diet, and that for his hereditary Dominions, it would be hard for him to make them come to the Council, if the Cup and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Prieſts were not again allowed them. Theſe propoſals did not pleaſe the Pope: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would never ſuffer the matters which had been already decided at <hi>Trent,</hi> to be examined over again, if it ſhould coſt him his life; that as to the Reſtitution of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99003:188"/>and the Marriage of Prieſts which were onely of poſitive right, he ſhould refer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Council, but that he would act nothing of himſelf alone, though he had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to doe ſo.</p>

The King was, therefore obliged to call a numerous Aſſembly of the chief of the Kingdom to meet at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainebleau</hi> the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the ſame year 1560. <hi>Jean de Mouluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> who was no Enemy to the Proteſtants, and who wiſhed for ſome Reformation in the Church, gave his Judgment there for a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Council, and for the forbearance of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; affirming that People were amazed at the Conſtancy of thoſe that ſuffered, which made them inform themſelves about their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; he was ſeconded by a great many more; and Admiral <hi>Coligny</hi> himſelf preſented to the King Petitions that had been delivered to him in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which begg'd that a ſtop might be put to all Severities, untill the Cauſe ſhould be tried. He added that having enquired whence theſe Petitions came, they had made him anſwer that fifty thouſand were ready to ſet their hands to them. The Duke and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi> oppoſed theſe opinions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a national Council, voted for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Severities. The concluſion of the Aſſembly was, an Edict ordaining the States to meet at <hi>Meaux</hi> the tenth of <hi>December</hi> enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that if a General Council were not called, the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> ſhould aſſemble the thirteenth of <hi>January</hi> following, that they might take their meaſures for holding of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99003:188"/>Council; and that in the mean time Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities ſhould ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>That Aſſembly of <hi>Fontainebleau</hi> gave the Pope freſh Jealouſies, and he was the more afraid of the National Council, becauſe he found that the Proteſtants likewiſe demanded it. He ſent therefore orders to the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> his Legate in <hi>France</hi> to endeavour what lay in his power to prevent the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Biſhops, and preſſed the affair of calling the General Council. He propoſed it once again to the Ambaſſadours, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them the diſorders that would be occaſioned by a National Synod; but he could not forbear diſcovering the true reaſon of the hatred which he bore to theſe National Synods in which he had not the abſolute power. They pretend, ſaid he, to ſubject the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to a Council, but I am ready to lay down my life rather than to ſuffer it: <hi>Pro fide &amp; religione volumus mori.</hi> He would have the Miniſters of Princes to give their opinions concerning that affair. The Emperour's Ambaſſadour, according to his Maſter's intention was of the mind that the matter ſhould not be haſtened too much, that a Diet might be aſſembled to conſult about it: but the other Ambaſſadours conſented to a ſpeedy Convocation of the Council according to the intentions of the Pope In the mean time, the Politicians look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon all this eagerneſs of the Pope to be a kind of Comedy. For they thought it a clear caſe, that if he could not avoid a Council, he would at leaſt endeavour to put it off untill he had enriched his Family and his Nephews;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99003:189"/>and that afterwards he would be willing to give others good Examples of frugality and moderation, and bear more eaſily with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations that might be made in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. About the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> Letters came to <hi>Rome</hi> from the Emperour's Court, ſtill preſſing that the Council might not be called at <hi>Trent,</hi> and that that Convocation might not paſs for a Continuation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Council, becauſe the Place and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation would be ſtumbling blocks to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and would raiſe difficulties never to be ſurmounted. <hi>France</hi> continued likewiſe in the ſame mind, and the Union of thoſe two great Powers in the ſame Sentiments, put the Pope into a great deal of perplexity, and made him thereupon hold ſeveral Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At length he reſolved to paſs over all theſe difficulties, he minuted the Bull of Convocation,<note place="margin">The Pope formes the Bull of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council, and ſtill chuſes the City of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                     </note> and deviſed a form that might give content to all, as well thoſe who were onely for removing the Suſpenſion of the Council, as the reſt who deſired a Council to be called anew. He gave this title to his Bull, <hi>The Indiction of the Council of Trent,</hi> which ſeemed to inſinuate that it was to be a new Council: but in the body of the Bull, he ſaid that he removed the Suſpenſion, and made uſe of the word <hi>Continue.</hi> This middle way contented no body, and diſpleaſed both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: However the Pope did all he could to perſwade Princes to be ſatisfied, and ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his Miniſters in <hi>France</hi> to endeavour to remove all Scruples about the word <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,</hi> becauſe that ſhould not hinder but that the affairs which had been decided under <hi>Paul</hi>

The death of this Prince put the Proteſtants in heart, and made them hope for a change in affairs, becauſe the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> firſt Prince of the bloud was to have a great ſhare in the Government during the King's Minority. Now this King was a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Proteſtant, and was influenc'd by the Councils of Admiral <hi>Coligny</hi> a great Protectour of the Proteſtants.

The Edict
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99003:190"/>paſt and at the ſame time the King gave orders to the Prelates to prepare themſelves to goe to <hi>Trent</hi> to the Council. The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> who ſpoke for the Gentry, preſented a Petition in name of the Gentlemen for obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning permiſſion for the publick Exerciſe of the reformed Religion; but no anſwer was given to that Petition, it was referred to the States which were to meet in <hi>May</hi> following.

As concerning the Council, they reſolved to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Emperour, that he would procure one which might be free, where the Pope ſhould not preſide, and wherein the Proteſtant-Divines might have a Vote.

As for the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and heard them civilly, but they ſent
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:99003:191"/>them back the Pope's Briefs ſealed up as they had preſented them; and having conſidered what anſwer they ſhould make, they thought it beſt to tell them in plain terms, that they acknowledged not the Pope's Juriſdiction, that they were not obliged to declare to him their thoughts concerning a Council, and that they had acquainted the Emperour with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions as to that. The <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s met with no better reception at <hi>Nuremberg, Franckfort, Ausburg,</hi> and in all the other Proteſtant Towns: but the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was more rude with them ſtill; for he commanded them not to enter within his Dominions, and ſent them word that neither his Father nor he having ever had any buſineſs with the Pope, he would receive no Ambaſſadours from him. That anſwer extremely vexed the <hi>Nuncio Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> who had ſtopt at <hi>Lubeck</hi> expecting the King's Paſsports to come into <hi>Denmark.</hi> And it was no ſmall mortification to the Pope, that after he had ſtoopt ſo low as to ſend <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s to thoſe whom he lookt upon as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, he ſhould be ſlighted by them in that manner; but it was ſtill ſome comfort, that his friends made it their buſineſs to give it out in all places, that that great condeſcenſion was an effect of his Singular Piety and Zeal.

So
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:99003:191"/>that every where almoſt the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s met with oppoſition; for the Emperour himſelf made a kind of an ambiguous anſwer, and inſiſted that that Aſſembly might paſs for a new Council. <hi>Spain</hi> on the other hand, ſtumbled at the title of Indiction, and would onely have it to be a removal of the Suſpenſion, demanding that it might be expreſly declared, that that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was a Continuation of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But on the contrary, <hi>France</hi> openly demanded an amendment in the Bull as to the point of Continuation, urging that it ſhould no where be called the Continuation of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> It was likewiſe taken ill that the King of <hi>France</hi> was not expreſly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Bull, ſeeing the Dignity of ſo great a Monarch did not admit that he ſhould be caſt in with others, and onely deſigned in general terms. The Pope had done ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not name him before the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and durſt not name him after.

This did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Pope's Anxiety: and therefore he ſent the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> to that Aſſembly, to have an Eye over it, that nothing might be acted there contrary to his Authority.

                  <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> came therefore into <hi>France</hi> to oppoſe the Torrent which threatned an inundation in that Kingdom, through the Authority of ſeveral great men who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the party of the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> About the ſame time there was a train diſcovered, laid by the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> not onely againſt the Proteſtant Religion, but againſt the State alſo.

He wrote to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> that they had no power to make Edicts in matters which concerned Religion in General, that if they adventured upon any thing beyond the reach of their power, he would reſcind all that they did, and proceed againſt them with all rigour. The Biſhops did not much value theſe threats; onely aſſured the Pope that he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſtartled at that Aſſembly. <hi>France</hi> was an inexhauſtible Spring of Troubles for the Pope, from thence they flowed daily upon him; and it was no ſmall vexation that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Eſtates at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> wherein upon a debate that aroſe about Precedence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Princes and the Cardinals, it was judged in favour of the Princes againſt the Cardinals. The Cardinals of <hi>Chatillon</hi> and <hi>Armagnac</hi> yielded, but thoſe of <hi>Tournon, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> and <hi>Guiſe</hi> withdrew, murmuring againſt their Collegues. This vexed the Pope indeed, but he was touched to the quick by a letter which he received from the Queen Regent da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wherein ſhe bewailed the ſad condition of <hi>France,</hi> and the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of the Proteſtant Party, propoſing to him ſome Remedies which ſhe thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the preſent juncture; that is, ſeveral Reformations which according to her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be made in Religion, as the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Images out of Churches, the abolition of the uſe of Spittle and Exorciſms in Baptiſm,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99003:194"/>the allowing the Cup to the People, the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Vulgar Tongue in Divine Service, and the abrogating of the Feſtival of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> which had onely been inſtituted for Pomp. This Letter was written with great freedom, and <hi>John de Monluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> was thought to have had a hand in it. The Pope perceived that it was now high time to make uſe of Remedies, and that it was neceſſary to haſten the Council. There was none now but the Emperour who oppoſed it, but in the very nick of time, the Pope recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his conſent in terms of great ſubmiſſion to that Aſſembly, which was very Joyfull News. The <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops had no great mind to goe to the Council; but the Pope forced them to it, that they might Counterbalance the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who as he ſaid, came onely to ſubject the Pope to a Council, an attempt which the <hi>Italians,</hi> who have the honour to have the Head of the Church in their Countrey, ought vigorouſly to oppoſe.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:99003:194"/>of State of Officiate as Clerk. In opening the Aſſembly the Chancellour made a long Speech, wherein he touched at ſeveral things which did not pleaſe the zealous favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they might very well be without the Aid of the Pope and of a General Council, in determining differences in Religion, and that many times Provincial Synods had rectified the miſtakes of General Councils. As an Inſtance of this he named the Provincial Synod held in <hi>France</hi> by St. <hi>Hilary</hi> which rejected <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> that had been eſtabliſhed by the General Council of <hi>Rimini.</hi> He farther added that the Proteſtants were Chriſtians, having the ſame Baptiſm, the ſame God, and the ſame <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Catholicks</hi> had, and that therefore People muſt ſhake off that prejudice and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they entertained againſt them. This Speech, whereof a Copy was ſent to the Pope, ſo highly diſpleaſed him, that he threatned to ſummon the Chancellour to appear before the Tribunal of the Inquiſition as a Heretick. The Cardinals of <hi>Tournon</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> demanded a Copy of it, but it was refuſed them. This whole Conference was ſpent in Harangues on both ſides, in diſcourſes and private conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to try if any Points could be couched in general terms which both Parties might ſign: and particularly much time was taken up in minuting, changing and correcting a Deciſion concerning the Euchariſt that might give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to all, but they could not ſucceed in it. One day the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> thought to have gravelled <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> concerning that Point of the Euchariſt, he asked him briskly
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:99003:195"/>if his Collegues and he would refuſe to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg</hi> as to that particular? This put <hi>Beza</hi> to ſome ſtand, but preſently recollecting himſelf, he demanded of the Cardinal, in whoſe name do you ask that queſtion, will you and your Collegues Subſcribe to that confeſſion in all Points? The Cardinal was now put to it as well as he, and having nothing to reply, <hi>Beza</hi> thought it not fit neither to give a more particular anſwer. And ſo all the Pains that was taken to adjuſt matters was fruitleſs, and the conference had no ſucceſs. A <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite of the Retinue of the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſignaliſed himſelf in that conference by his boldneſs. He roſe up in the midſt of the Aſſembly, and without any warrant to ſpeak, fell foul on the Proteſtants, and cenſured the Queen very ſharply, in that ſhe medled with matters which did not at all concern her. She took that inſolent rebuke very ill, but then was the time of ſuffering. The Pope was much pleaſed to hear that the conference had produced no effect.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament was informed that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who came into <hi>France</hi> whilſt the conference was on foot, had amongſt his other Inſtructions one Point which concerned the revocation of the Articles of Reformation decreed in the Eſtates of <hi>Orleans</hi> the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and eſpecially of that which prohibited the carrying of Money to <hi>Rome</hi> under pretext of <hi>Annates,</hi> or of obtaining of Diſpenſations and Benefices. They therefore ſpeedily confirmed the Articles of the Eſtates at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and when the Legate according to cuſtome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Commiſſion to be confirmed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:99003:195"/>becauſe without that confirmation he could not diſcharge the Office of Legate, it was even refuſed him. Nor was that rub the onely trouble he met with; ſeveral Libels were publiſhed againſt him, wherein they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up the horrid Impurities of <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. Father to <hi>Lucretia Borgia</hi> the Cardinal's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the enormous filthineſs of this <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> who lay with her Father, and was, as they ſaid, Daughter and Concubine to that Pope. The Legate perceived the times were not fit to carry things by Authority, and therefore he made it his buſineſs to win the minds of the People, and went ſo far in that complaiſance, that he even converſed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Huguenots,</hi> ate with them, and went to hear their Sermons: but that way did not take as he expected.</p>
                  <p>The Conference of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> did good to no Party: It made the Queen be ill thought of by all the Princes of her Religion, ſo that ſhe was fain to make her Apology to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was a mortal Enemy to thoſe ways of tampering, and was on all occaſions for her employing Fire and Sword as he had done. But above all, ſhe had much adoe to Juſtifie her ſelf to the Pope: and yet when ſhe made her Apology to him, ſhe had ſo much confidence as to deſire favours of him; for ſhe endeavoured to procure the Legation of <hi>Avignon</hi> for the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> That propoſal was rejected with much indignation, and ſome great deſign was ſuſpected to be hid under it, which perhaps, was true enough. The <hi>French</hi> Biſhops continued at <hi>Poiſſy</hi> after the breaking up of the conference; and though
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99003:196"/>they had promiſed not to meddle with any thing but civil matters, yet they diſcourſed of reſtoring the Communion under both kinds. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was even of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and he brought over with him the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> They reſolved to demand it of the Pope, and the Legate wrote to him about it. The Pope ſeemed at firſt to condeſcend; but having called together the Cardinals, they withſtood it tooth and nail, inſomuch that they called the <hi>French</hi> who had made that demand, Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: He therefore referred the matter to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> who was a man of a very prudent Conduct, and extreme ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to all People, even to the Enemies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> prevailed ſo far by his ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, that he obtained a Suſpenſion of the Decrees of the Eſtates at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to execute his Legation in <hi>France,</hi> giving a counter promiſe that he would not make uſe of that permiſſion. The King was willing to grant him that for formalities ſake, and that he might not have the diſgrace of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back without being owned for Legate. The Chancelour would not ſign the Brief, ſo that it was onely ſigned by the King, Queen and chief Officers of the Crown.</p>

                     </note>This demand of the Cup made by the <hi>French,</hi> with the other matters that had paſt in <hi>France,</hi> began already to beget ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of them: and theſe ſuſpicions were much encreaſed by news that came from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> which gave out that the <hi>German</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had received Letters from <hi>France</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to continue ſteadfaſt in their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:99003:196"/>with promiſes that the <hi>French</hi> would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them in the Council. The <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour did what he could at <hi>Rome</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe ſuſpicions; but to no purpoſe, for ſome new thing happened daily that revived the diſcontents and heartburnings of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> as was the buſineſs of <hi>Tanquerel. John Tanquerel</hi> a Batchelour in Divinity, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed <hi>Theſes</hi> to be defended, wherein he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the Pope as Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> could deprive Princes that were diſobedient to him of their Dignities and Kingdoms. For this he was by a Decree of Parliament, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to make a publick Recantation, and becauſe he had fled for it, the Bedle appeared for him, and made the Recantation in his name. This ruined the Reputation in his name. This ruined the Reputation of the <hi>French</hi> for good and all; for to deny the Pope's Power over Kings in Temporals, is lookt upon at <hi>Rome</hi> as a capital Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">After many delays, the Pope will have the Council opened.</note>Whilſt affairs were in this condition, the Legates and many Biſhops had been at <hi>Trent</hi> ever ſince <hi>Eaſter</hi> expecting the opening of the Council, which was put off from day to day. The Pope at length, being weary of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, reſolved to order the opening of it. For that end he called a Congregation of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and laid before them the neceſſity of opening the Council; of which they were very ſenſible, and thought it not fit to make longer delay. The Pope had appointed the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> to be a Collegue to the firſt two; and to theſe three he added two more, to wit, Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> a learned man in the Canon-Law, and Cardinal <hi>d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps</hi> his Nephew by the Siſter. <hi>Simoneta</hi> came
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99003:197"/>to <hi>Trent</hi> the ninth of <hi>December.</hi> He was a zealous Protector of the rights and pretenſions of the Holy See, and was therefore entruſted with all the Pope's Secrets, at parting he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders to open the Council ſo ſoon as he arrived at <hi>Trent:</hi> but upon his coming, he received a Letter from the Pope which order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſtill to defer it till after <hi>New-Years</hi> day. The Emperour's Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> had procured this delay, that the Ambaſſadours whom his Maſter was to ſend to <hi>Trent</hi> might be there at the opening of the Council, and he hoped that they might get thither by the middle of <hi>January.</hi> About that time two <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Biſhops came to the Council: they viſited the Legates, and acquainted them that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> uſed great endeavours to bring their pretended Reformation into <hi>Poland;</hi> that the Biſhops could not leave their Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were obliged continually to watch the motions of theſe Enemies; that therefore they demanded that they might have their place and votes in the Council by Proxies: and ſeeing theſe two Biſhops were charged with Procurations from all the reſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that they two alone might have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Votes as they had Procurations. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates anſwered them civilly in general terms, but without determining any thing, and in the mean time wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> concerning this matter. The Pope thereupon called a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, where the Propoſal was rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was contrary to what had been reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon at the very firſt Convocation of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> that the Votes ſhould not be taken by Nations but by Heads. There
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:99003:197"/>was danger they knew, in granting what they demanded, becauſe all other Nations would have expected the ſame privilege: So that the <hi>Italians</hi> who carried it far by number would quickly have loſt the plurality of Votes, which was always on their ſide. The <hi>French</hi> were to be in the Council with their Maxims of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which are ſo inconſiſtent with the Grandure of the Holy See. The intentions of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not much more favourable to the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> for they already ſlyly propoſed that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope ought to be limited, and the privileges of the Biſhops enlarged. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they were for taking from the Pope the power of diſpenſing with the Canons of the preſent Council, becauſe that otherwiſe it would be in vain to hold Councils at ſo great charge for making of Canons, which after all, would bind the Pope no farther than he ſhould think good. Hence it was concluded, that if the <hi>Poles, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were permitted to ſit in Council by Proxies and Procurations, there would be as many Votes as there are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in thoſe Kingdoms, who would carry all by plurality of Votes, and that the <hi>Italians</hi> would be too weak to hinder the <hi>Tramontani</hi> from over-ruling the Council. For all theſe reaſons the <hi>Poles</hi> got no other ſatisfaction but fair words: they promiſed to doe any thing elſe they pleaſed to demand for their generous Nation; but that they could not alter the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that were fixed by the Council, of which the preſent Aſſembly was but a Continuation. The <hi>Poles</hi> made no great buſtle about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but within a few days after, under pretext
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:99003:198"/>of buſineſs at <hi>Venice,</hi> they went away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no more.</p>
                  <p>The Pope diſcovering more and more the deſigns that the <hi>Tramontani</hi> had of clipping the Wings of his Authority, thought it not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient any longer to delay the opening of the Council, but that it behoved him to endeavour to break that Party before it was more firmly linkt and knit together. He therefore wrote to <hi>Trent</hi> that they ſhould open the Council ſo ſoon as the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Emperour's and <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadours ſhould arrive; but that if theſe Miniſters did not come before the middle of <hi>January,</hi> it ſhould be no hinderance to the opening of the Council.</p>

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:99003:199"/>which have been occaſioned upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Dignities and Privileges of Sees, the Prelates ſhould be placed according to their Seniority in promotion, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Dignities enjoying Primacy. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeo di Martiri</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Braganza</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> vigorouſly oppoſed this Order, and could not endure to think that a Pettie Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Roſano</hi> who has not one Suffragan, or of <hi>Niſſia,</hi> a little Iſle in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> or of <hi>Antivari</hi> in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> who have not ſo much as one Chriſtian under their Juriſdiction, and never reſide in their Sees, ſhould take place of Archbiſhops of Churches having Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, conſiderable in Dignity and Privileges, for no other reaſon but that of Seniority in Promotion. However he muſt bear with that, and be ſatisfied with a Declaration in writing, importing that it was not the intention of the Pope nor Council to derogate from any man's rights, but that after the Council was over, all men might enjoy their ſeveral Privileges. In the ſame Congregation the <hi>Spaniards</hi> urged that the Council might be reckoned a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the former, and ſo declared in the firſt Act of the Seſſion. The Biſhop of <hi>Zante</hi> in compliance with the Intereſts of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and King of <hi>France</hi> who deſired the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, oppoſed it: but though the Legates of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Warmia</hi> ſeconded the opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Zante;</hi> yet the matter paſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it had been reſolved at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ordered in the Bull.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99003:199"/>Legatis,</hi> whereby it was ordained that no propoſal ſhould be made but by the Legates.

They were apprehenſive likewiſe of Princes, who by their Ambaſſadours might make Overtures diſadvantageous to the Holy See, and contrary to its Intereſts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was thought fit that they, who had any thing to propoſe, ſhould apply themſelves to the Legates, without whoſe conſent nothing could be examined in the Council.

The Enemies of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> objected it to him as a Crime that he read and peruſed the Books of <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers; and he blames him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it, ſaying that he was one day laſht before the Tribunal of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for his Curioſity in having read too much of the Works of <hi>Cicero.</hi> However they made no Catalogue of the Books of Hereticks or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, that they might forbid the reading of them. The Emperours, indeed, did ſometimes prohibit the Books of Hereticks. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> prohibited the <hi>Arian, Arcadius</hi> the <hi>Eunomian</hi> and <hi>Manichean, Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99003:201"/>
                     <hi>Martian</hi> the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Books; but the Biſhops medled not with them, or, at leaſt, did not take that Authority upon them. In proceſs of time it became a Cuſtome to make Catalogues of <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, that is, of Books not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as Pope <hi>Gelaſus</hi> did in the end of the fifth Century. But the reading of thoſe Books was not prohibited, it ſerved onely for a Rule to Believers, that they might know what to rely upon, and what Doctrines they were to receive or to reject. Since the year eight hundred, there are ſome inſtances of Books condemned and prohibited by Popes; but theſe inſtances are very rare. <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth condemned <hi>Wiclef</hi> and his followers, and excommunicated them; nevertheleſs he did not prohibit their Books. <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was the firſt that brought this Cuſtome moſt in vogue; for he prohibited the reading of all <hi>Luther</hi>'s Books under pain of Excommunication, and ſince that, the Popes in the Bull <hi>de Coena Domini</hi> have excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all thoſe who read the Books of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. In theſe Prohibitions the Books were not named but in General, which cauſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Confuſion, becauſe dangerous Books not being diſtinguiſhed by the Names of their Authours and Titles, one muſt read over a Book to know whether it were dangerous or not, and when that was done, it was not ſo eaſie a matter to agree upon the nature of what was contained in it, ſome maintaining the Book to be good, and others condemning it as naught. Therefore the Inquiſitours in ſeveral places, for their own uſe made Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Books, the reading of which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prohibit. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99003:201"/>Prince againſt the progreſs of the new Doctrine, in the year 1558. cauſed all the Books which the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, to be reduced into a more ample Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, and to be printed. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. did the like at <hi>Rome,</hi> and theſe are the ancienteſt and moſt famed <hi>Indices Expurgatorii.</hi> Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> beſides Authours who were reckoned Hereticks, put into his Catalogue many of the Works of Authours that paſt for Catholicks, nay and ſome Books which had been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Popes, amongſt others <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Annotations upon the New-Teſtament, which <hi>Leo</hi> X. had approved by a Brief. That Pope, who was ſo zealous for the greatneſs of his See, crouded into his Catalogue all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours whom he did not think favourable enough to the Holy See of <hi>Rome.</hi> They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as abſolutely and under pain of Excommunication to prohibit the reading of all Books which had been printed by ſome certain Printers who were named, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of threeſcore and two: and the Penalties annexed to theſe prohibitions were ſo rigorous that the Pope reſerved to himſelf the abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who had incurred the Cenſures of prohibited Books. The exceſſiveneſs of this rigour was complained of to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. who referred the whole matter to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                  <p>As to this point Opinions were extremely divided, ſome thought it not fit to meddle with what had been done by <hi>Paul</hi> IV. that that Catalogue was abſolutely to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that ſo, the beſt Courſe that could be taken, was not to take any notice of that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99003:202"/>affair. What matter, ſaid <hi>Luigi Beccatelli</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> though amongſt thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Books there may be ſome Works that deſerve not to be blaſted, there are but too many Books in the World, ſince printing hath been invented? It were better to prohibit a thouſand good Books, ſince there would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſtill remaining, than not to prohibit a bad one. But <hi>Thomas de</hi> St. <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop <hi>Della Cava</hi> was of a contrary opinion; his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was that that matter ought to be re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, becauſe the <hi>Tramontani,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>French</hi> abhorred every thing that came from the Tribunal of the Inquiſition; on the contrary they had a Veneration for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and therefore they did not regard what was done by the Inquiſitours, if the Council did not interfere; beſides, ſaid he, Laws which cannot be obeyed, muſt of neceſſity be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Indeed, ſo great was the number of prohibited Books, and the Cenſures ſo ſevere, that it was impoſſible but many muſt needs incur the pain of Excommunication. They who were of this opinion urged alſo, that in the Examination of Books, care ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not to condemn men without a hearing, and that therefore the Parties concerned, if they were Catholicks, ought to be called; or the Authours themſelves if they were ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, or their Relations who concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the reputation of the deceaſed; ſome were even for calling the Proteſtant Authours before their works were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. As to the matter of the Safe-conduct, opinions varied alſo. The Cardinals of <hi>Mantua</hi> and ſome others were for granting
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:99003:202"/>a very General one with an oblivion for all that was paſt: but the Inquiſitours of <hi>Spain</hi> withſtood that, becauſe they were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that under the protection of a General Safe-conduct and of that oblivion, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Spaniards</hi> might pull off the Vizard, and declare themſelves Proteſtants. As to the firſt of theſe points, it was reſolved that the Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory Index ſhould be reviewed, and that Deputies ſhould be named for that effect. As to the ſecond that notice ſhould be given to the Parties concerned, that the Council was ready to hear them, if they had any thing to ſay in their own Juſtification: and the matter of the Safe-conduct was referred to another time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the fifth Cardinal <hi>Altemps</hi> the Pope's Nephew, and fifth Legate arrived, and next day after <hi>Anthony Muglits</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> the Emperour's Ambaſſadour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Congregation. He pretended to have place above Cardinal <hi>Madruccio,</hi> as repreſenting the Emperour, but he could not obtain it. The ninth of the ſame month <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Martinez Maſcarenno</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was received into the Council, which muſt needs have the patience to hear the long Harangue of a certain Doctour of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, in praiſe of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the Ambaſſadour: and on the Eleventh the <hi>Sieur Sigiſmund Thurin</hi> the Emperour's ſecond Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour was received with very little Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. In this Congregation of the Eleventh, Commiſſioners were appointed to frame the <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> to wit, <hi>George Draskevits</hi> Biſhop of the five Churches, the Emperour's Ambaſſadour for the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary, John Treviſano</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Venice,</hi> four Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:99003:203"/>nine Biſhops, one Abbot and two Generals of Orders.</p>
                  <p>In the Congregation held the thirteenth of the ſame Month, the Emperour's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours preſented five Demands in writing; firſt, that they would ſpare the terms of <hi>Continuation</hi> of the Council; ſecondly, that the next Seſſion might be delayed; thirdly, that they would not irritate thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> by condemning their Books; fourthly, that the Proteſtants might have a very ample Paſport, and fifthly that Secrecy might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in all matters that ſhould be handled in the Congregations. Theſe five Demands were by the Legates in a manner granted to the Ambaſſadours. At the ſame time <hi>George Draskevits</hi> Biſhop of the five Churches the Emperour's third Ambaſſadour, whom he ſent from the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> appeared at <hi>Trent</hi> in Quality of Ambaſſadour: he had been in the Council ever ſince <hi>January,</hi> but onely with the Character of a Biſhop: but in the twenty fourth of <hi>February</hi> he preſented his Commiſſion, and made a long diſcourſe in praiſe of his Maſter; at that meeting the Fathers of the Council were ſtrictly enjoyned Secrecy. About the ſame time <hi>Lewis de Saint Gelais</hi> Lord of <hi>Lanſac</hi> was ſent from <hi>France</hi> Ambaſſadour extraordinary to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope was highly offended that the liberty of preaching had been granted to the Proteſtants by the Edict of <hi>January:</hi> and <hi>Lanſac</hi>'s chief inſtructions were to excuſe that action. He caſt the blame upon the misfortune of the times, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of reſiſting ſo great a Torrent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of the great men were engaged in
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99003:203"/>that Party. The Pope was not ſatisfied with theſe excuſes, ſaying that he prayed God to pardon thoſe who were the cauſe of ſo many evils.<note place="margin">The Deſigns of the Queen of <hi>France</hi> for Reformation.</note> However deſigns of afar different nature were hatching in <hi>France,</hi> which would have netled the Pope much more, if he had known them. The Queen mother ſent for the Biſhops of <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Seez,</hi> the Doctours <hi>Bouthilier, Diſpenſe, Picherel</hi> and <hi>Maillard</hi> famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, to St. <hi>Germain,</hi> that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult together about the Reformation of the abuſes committed in the uſe of Images. They were all almoſt of opinion to prohibit the making of any Images of the Trinity, the rendering any worſhip to other Images, and the carrying of any in proceſſion but the Croſs. But <hi>Nicholas Maillard</hi> Dean of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> did ſo oppoſe it, that in this nothing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, no more than in the Conference at <hi>Poiſſy.</hi> Theſe Conferences were procured by the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who favoured the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but durſt not advance towards it but ſlowly. The Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> entertained far contrary deſigns to thoſe of the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> but by an action they did at this time they eaſily made it appear that what they would have had taken for Zeal in Religion, was a piece of carnal Wiſedom, that ſtruck at the Ruine of a Party which obſtructed their way to the Crown. They had a Conference at <hi>Saverne</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> a Proteſtant Prince and his Miniſters. In this Conference they endeavoured to engage the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in a League againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> under Pretext that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:99003:204"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> were <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and different from them in their opinion about the Euchariſt. Theſe ſo <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes were very willing to enter into Alliance with Hereticks, that did them no prejudice, for the Ruine of other Hereticks who ſtood too much in their way as they thought; but this Conduct created Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies in the minds both of the Pope and King of <hi>France;</hi> becauſe the King did not like that his Subjects ſhould entertain ſecret Conferences with Strangers, and the Pope underſtood not the meaning of ſuch a Union with Hereticks: and it was this interview, perhaps, that gave occaſion to the Rumour that was ſpread abroad afterwards, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was very favourable to the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg:</hi> Nay it was reported of him that after the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, that he had been once of the opinion of that Confeſſion, but that after the Deciſions of the Council he had ſubmitted. <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>February</hi> 26 the Seſſion was held, wherein there happened ſome Conteſts about Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Ambaſſadours. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Hungary</hi> as being a Biſhop ſate on the left ſide of the Church, on the Legates right hand, in the rank of the Prelates; and he of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as being a Secular, ſate on the right ſide, where the Ambaſſadours and Oratours of Princes were placed. So that in that reſpect they could have no Debate; but the Quarel broke out when the Inſtructions of their Princes were to be read. To compoſe this difference without prejudicing the Rights of the Parties, the Council ordered that theſe Inſtructions
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:99003:204"/>ſhould be read according to the order of time wherein they had been preſented; and ſo <hi>Portugal</hi> went firſt. Then the Pope's Brief, whereby the matter of the <hi>Index</hi> was referred to the Council, was read; for ſeeing Pope <hi>Paul</hi> had medled in that affair, the Council thinking that the Holy See had taken the Cogniſance thereof to it ſelf, would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Examination of it without the Pope's permiſſion. Laſt of all the Decree was read by <hi>Antonio Helio</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had officiated. This Decree imported that the matter of the <hi>Index</hi> was referred to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee named by the Council; that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil invited all who had made Separation from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to peace and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, promiſing, in Congregation, to grant them a Safe-conduct, in the ſame form as had been formerly granted; and the next Seſſion was appointed to be the 14th. of <hi>March.</hi> The Legates had written to <hi>Rome</hi> to know in what form they ſhould invite thoſe who had ſhaken off the Yoke of the Church, to repentance, and of what extent the Safe-conduct ſhould be. The Pope judged it not convenient to grant an oblivion, nor to invite Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was his opinion, it would be to no purpoſe; and for the Safe-conduct, he thought it might be granted in General terms accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the form of that which was given to the <hi>Germans</hi> in the year 1552. but he would not condeſcend that the ſame Safe-conduct ſhould be granted to thoſe who lived under the Inquiſition. Nevertheleſs he would not have that exception mentioned, leſt it might be thought that the Pope had not a Supreme
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:99003:205"/>Power over the Tribunal of the Inquiſition, and that he could not exempt any from the Rigours of the ſame. In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> the Council held ſeveral Congregations about that point, and at length the Legates brought matters ſo about, that the reſolutions of the Council agreed exactly with the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Pope. So they adjuſted the form of the Decree, which was divided into three Articles. In the firſt the Council granted the <hi>Germans</hi> a Safe-conduct in the ſame form as it had been granted them before. In the ſecond this Safe-conduct was extended to all places where they preached, and publickly taught Doctrines contrary to the Doctrine of the Church. In the third it contained this Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that though the Safe-conduct ſeemed not to extend to all Nations, yet none who would return into the boſome of the Church ſhould be excluded from the benefit of the Oblivion, and that a Safe-conduct was alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for that third ſort. But as to theſe laſt, the Council did not perform the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadours were ſtill for preſſing a Reformation, and now the Emperour's Miniſters deſired that they would write to the Proteſtants to invite them to the Council. As to this laſt point the Legates anſwered, that that was the way to expoſe the Councils Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the danger of being uſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s of his Holineſs had been already ſerved; that is, with inſolence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity. As to the matter of Reformation, having firſt twitted them with the abſence of the <hi>German</hi> Prelates who of all others ſtood moſt in need of being reformed, they reſolved
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:99003:205"/>to give them ſome ſatisfaction. And therefore on the Eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> the Legates cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a General Congregation, wherein they propoſed twelve or thirteen Articles relating to Reformation, as concerning Reſidence,<note place="margin">The Legates propoſe twelve Articles tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſixteenth of <hi>March</hi> the Council gave Audience to <hi>Ferdinando d' Avalos</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> Ambaſſadour from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Governour of <hi>Milan;</hi> wherein the uſual Complements were mutually interchanged.

                  <p>After the <hi>Eaſter</hi>-holy-days, the Congregations were held without interruption from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>April</hi> untill the eighteenth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the matters which had been propoſed in the Congregation of the Eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> were brought under Debate. In the firſt place the point of Reſidence was argued with ſtrange heats;<note place="margin">They enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Point of the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> the Pope's faction eſſayed to put a ſtop to that deliberation, alledging that it was a matter concluded under <hi>Paul</hi> III and that the care of putting in execution what had been decreed ſhould be left to the People. But the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were for bringing the matter under examination again, ſaying that a more effectual means had been propoſed to oblige to Reſidence,<note place="margin">And the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion if it be of Divine right is again ſtarted. This Point is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary heat.</note> than thoſe that were pitcht upon in the firſt Convocation; and that was to declare it to be of Divine Right; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put the Council into a Fermentation. <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nocera,</hi> who made himſelf remarkable by the ſingularity of his reaſons, was againſt the having it declared either neceſſary or of Divine Right. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the Churches wherein Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided were not a whit better governed than thoſe wherein Biſhops made no Reſidence; and was ſo plain as to urge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf for an inſtance which was full of Corruptions notwithſtanding that for many
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:99003:206"/>ages the Pope had continually reſided there. He added that if Reſidence were declared to be of Divine Right, it would prove a Source of Rebellion; becauſe when an heretical or ſcandalous Biſhop was got into poſſeſſion of a Church, the Pope could never be able to puniſh him; ſeeing under pretext that Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is of Divine Right, he might refuſe to leave his See to come to an appearance; that upon the ſame Principle the Curates alſo would find a means to decline the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Biſhops, alledging that by the Law of God they are placed immediate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of their Flocks. <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aiace</hi> ſtood up for the Divine Right of Reſidence; nevertheleſs he was not of opinion that that queſtion ſhould be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Council, becauſe that ſince the Council had no other aim but to oblige all to Reſidence, it would be enough to make a Decree prohibiting all Biſhops to diſcharge any ſecular office or employment in the Courts of Princes, and that then he was pretty ſure that few Biſhops would be ſeen abroad out of their own Churches. The Biſhop of the five Churches a <hi>Hungarian</hi> vigorouſly oppoſed this overture, and in a long Diſcourſe made it out that for the ſpace of eight hundred years Prelates had been employed in ſecular Affairs, not onely with great Succeſs but much Honour alſo to the Church, and profit and advantage to States, and that a cuſtome of ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance ought not to be condemned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here the Biſhops who were for the Divine Right of Reſidence made it viſibly appear that their own hearts deceived them, if they thought
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:99003:207"/>themſelves prompted on by the Zeal that a good Paſtour ought to have for the conduct of his Flock; for they liſtened to the opinion of the Biſhop of the five Churches with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary delight and gave it great applauſe. Nevertheleſs nothing could be more oppoſite to the deſign they had of aſſerting the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reſidence; for it is manifeſt that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſs and Employments wherein Biſhops are entangled are the greateſt obſtruction of Reſidence. But both they and the Biſhop of the five Churches jumpt in one and the ſame deſign, to wit, the Advancement of Epiſcopal dignity: And therefore they liked any thing that made for that, though it were by quite oppoſite courſes; all maintained their opinions in this cauſe, with inconceivable heat, and it was no eaſie matter to gather the Votes that the reſult might be known. Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> Legate held Reſidence to be of Poſitive Right; and the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> thought it to be of Divine Right; but durſt not declare himſelf openly, becauſe of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which could not endure that opinion; all that he ventured to doe was to affirm that the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Votes was on that ſide. He had two Legates who joyned with him: to wit, the Cardinals of <hi>Warmia</hi> and <hi>Seripando.</hi> But <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps</hi> the Pope's Nephew was for Cardinal <hi>Simoneta;</hi> who both maintained that the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Votes was for the Poſitive Right; for determining this difference a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was held on the twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> wherein the Preſidents prayed the Fathers to give their Judgments upon the point of the Divine Right of Reſidence by a <hi>placet</hi> or <hi>non

When the Votes were gathered, there were ſixty eight, who ſaid abſolutely <hi>placet</hi> for the Divine Right: thirty three who voted abſolutely <hi>non placet:</hi> thirteen who ſaid, <hi>placet conſulto prius ſanctiſſimo Domino noſtro,</hi> and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen who ſaid, <hi>non placet niſi prius conſulto ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimo, &amp;c.</hi> The Plurality was evidently for the Divine Right of Reſidence, ſince there were ſixty eight Votes to thirty three, beſides the thirteen who were for it with ſubmiſſion to the good will and pleaſure of the Pope; ſo that it ought to have been concluded; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that the Faction of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtarted great Debates, and the reſt of the Congregation was ſpent in much confuſion, which obliged the Legates to diſmiſs the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and having conſulted together, they reſolved to acquaint the Pope with all that had paſt, and to expect his anſwer. This was not managed ſo privately,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> make a great buſtle, becauſe the Legates will not frame the Decree of Reſidence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Plurality of Votes.</note> but that it came to the knowledge of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were for Reſidence <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complained of it, and ſaid that it was a palpable oppreſſion, that though a matter had been put to the Vote, and debated with all the Formalities, yet they would not ſubmit to the Plurality of Suffrages, that they ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Deciſion of a point, which had been lawfully determined in the Council; that that violent conduct contrary to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a Council had given ground to the blaſphemous ſaying which was in every body's mouth, that the Holy Ghoſt which preſided in the Council came weekly from <hi>Rome</hi> in the Cloak-back of a Courrier; and that nothing
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:99003:208"/>was more unlike a free Council, than the Aſſembly at <hi>Trent.</hi> In a ſubſequent Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation they would have brought the matter about again; but their minds were ſo exaſperated, that they could not be perſwaded to ſpeak with moderation, inſomuch that the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> who preſided in it, was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to break off the diſcourſe, and ſpeak of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſubject. To buſie the Prelates, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they would think of means of procuring the liberty of the Engliſh Catholick Biſhops who were in Priſon, that they might come to the Council. It was reckoned a very civil Propoſal, but very impoſſible to be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe no body was in a condition to conſtrain <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſhe was in no diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to value the Remonſtrances of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Whilſt the point of Reſidence was in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, other Articles of Reformation which had been propoſed by the Legates were alſo ſtarted in the ſame Congregations.<note place="margin">Of Prieſts without Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> The Scope of one of theſe Articles was to hinder the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Prieſts without a Title, that is to ſay, without a Benefice or an Eſtate of their own ſufficient to maintain them; becauſe that was the cauſe of the vaſt numbers of Indigent and Vagabond Prieſts. The Ancient Canons provided that no man ſhould be received into the Order of Prieſthood, if he had not a Benefice ſufficient to maintain him, and a Flock alſo to take the cure of, that Prieſts might not be without employment. The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> amongſt others prohibited Ordinations of Prieſts who had not a call to ſome Church. Long after that <hi>Alexander</hi> III. in the third <hi>Lateran</hi> Council held in the year
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:99003:208"/>1160. ordered that no Prieſt ſhould be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without a Title, unleſs he had an Eſtate ſufficient to maintain himſelf. But all this care has not as yet been able to prevent the being of a great many Vagabond and Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Prieſts; ſince the fortunes of ſuch men which are commonly very ſmall being ſpent, they muſt needs fall into Poverty. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> who held Reſidence to be of Divine Right, made it a Remedy againſt all Evils, and alledged it would prevent the diſorder they had before them; becauſe then Clerks could not be made without Benefices, nor Prieſts in Title of Eſtates without a Flock, and without doubt they were in the right. Others thought it hard that men other ways qualified for Orders, ſhould becauſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty be rejected, and ſaid, that it was no ſhame for the Poor Clergy to labour with their hands in imitation of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel; that, after all, the Poverty of Prieſts was uſefull to the Church, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the means of performing Offices for the Dead, which the Rich Prieſts would not take the pains to doe; ſeeing an Itinerane Prieſt without Benefice or Eſtate ſays Maſs for the Dead at a much cheaper rate, than they who are rich and have the cure of Souls. This opinion was not well reliſhed, becauſe it would have had Prieſts, who wanted buſineſs in the Church, to labour with their hands for a lively hood, which was not thought ſuitable to the Dignity of the Character. But another way to prevent the Poverty of Prieſts was propoſed, and that was, that a Biſhop ſhould ordain no man a Prieſt who had not a Benefice
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:99003:209"/>or Fortune ſufficient for his maintenance; and to hinder the ſquandering away of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies, that it ſhould be enacted that they could not be alienated: <hi>Gabriel le Veneur</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man Biſhop of <hi>Evreux</hi> did with much reaſon oppoſe this; alledging that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eſtates of Clergy-men were ſubject to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Laws, which many times appointed Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and that, though it were not ſo, yet ſuch a conſtitution would be a fair means to make Prieſts remiſs in paying their debts.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Free Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</note>The third Article related to the Money that is given when one receives Orders, not onely to the Biſhop and his Secretary, but to the Clark or Notary that expedes the Orders. Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>freely ye have received, freely give;</hi> for eluding the force of this Law, about the tenth Century they hit upon a knack of diſtinguiſhing in Ordination the Collation of Orders, from the Collation of the Benefice; they would not own the taking of any thing for Orders, becauſe it is a Spiritual Grace which cannot be ſold; but they would be payed for conferring the Benefice which is a Temporal Eſtate; and this kind of Simony got footing afterwards under the name of <hi>Annates</hi> or firſt fruits, fees, writing, ſeals, and other titles. The abuſe encreaſed by the inſtitution of Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant Biſhops, who now-a-days are called Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans. They are a kind of Lieutenants to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who perform the Eccleſiaſtick and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Functions of the Dioceſs, whilſt the true Biſhops in title, who enjoy the Revenues are wholly taken up with the cares of the World. Theſe Suffragan Biſhops having no Benefice nor Revenues, were forced for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:99003:209"/>to draw Preſents and take Alms from thoſe on whom they conferred Orders. The rich Biſhops who could eaſily diſpenſe with Alms, let fly againſt that abuſe, and called it downright Simony. On the contrary the poor Biſhops, who were preſent, wanted not argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that they might take free gifts from thoſe who received Orders; they alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that ſuch as would hinder thoſe free gifts, had a deſign to extinguiſh Charity, that the reaſons which they made uſe of ſtruck at all voluntary offerings that are made at Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at Maſs, and at Funerals. But the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all their reaſons was, that Biſhops might very well take ſome ſmall preſent for confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Orders, ſince at <hi>Rome</hi> vaſt ſumms of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were exacted for beſtowing the <hi>Pallium</hi> on <hi>Metropolitans:</hi> that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. in the fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, had decreed, that for the adminiſtration of Sacraments, believers ſhould make thoſe voluntary offerings, which at preſent they would condemn. For all theſe reaſons, one <hi>Denis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milopotamo</hi> in <hi>Candia</hi> went a great deal farther than any who had ſpoken before him: He alledged that the Clergy was not near the tenth part of the People, and yet they had the Tithes, which is the tenth part of the fruits of the Earth; beſides a great deal of Lands which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that amounts to much more: that if there were poor Biſhops, it was not to be imputed to the Poverty of the Church, but to the bad diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of its wealth; and that ſo, it was not to be ſuffered that the Church ſhould take money in conſideration of ſervices, for which ſhe was ſo well payed; he added, that it was not enough
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:99003:210"/>to prohibit Biſhops to take any thing for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Orders, unleſs they were likewiſe hindered from making money of thoſe things that goe before Orders; for inſtance in the Chanceries of Biſhops they granted Letters which were called Dimiſſorial, whereby a man was allowed to provide himſelf of an Ordainer where he thought good, and for theſe Letters money was taken. In like manner at <hi>Rome.</hi> permiſſions were granted for money, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Orders out of the times appointed for that. And therefore he moved that theſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might be remedied. The Legates appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that opinion as to Dimiſſorial Letters, which onely regard the Biſhop's Chanceries: but as to the Permiſſions that were given at <hi>Rome</hi> for money, that Court being a <hi>noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> ſaid, that it belonged to the Pope, and not to the Council to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that. In this manner the Legates, without having the Superiority of the Pope over a Council plainly aſſerted, acted in all things, as if that Superiority had been unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable: for if the Council were above the Pope, it would have power to reform the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Amongſt other conſiderations that were made on that ſubject, it was moved that Notaries and Clarks who wrote and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht the Orders, ought not to be barred from taking of money; becauſe it was a mere tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Office, and ſuch men ought to live by their Callings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of daily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions.</note>The fourth Article concerned Prebends and the Diſtributions in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, which have a Chapter and Canons. Heretofore the Canons lived in common and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:99003:210"/>ate all at one Table: or at leaſt they had a daily Diſtribution of what was neceſſary for them. This Diſtribution was made after Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, where they had aſſiſted at the hours appointed by the Canons: and hence it is that the hours appointed for Prayers have been called Canonical hours, and thoſe that did officiate at the Service <hi>Canonici</hi> or Canons. In the beginning this Diſtribution was made <hi>in ſpecie</hi> or in Money; but that laſted not long, and inſtead of thoſe Diſtributions which were made daily, the Revenues were divided, and each Canon had a Dividend, which Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends were called Prebends. When Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were in uſe, it made the Canons diligent in waiting on Service, becauſe nothing was given to the abſent: but ſo ſoon as Cathedral and Collegiate Revenues were divided into Prebends, every one received his Rent though he did no Service, and this made the Canons very negligent in performing their Duties; which negligence was thought to ſtand in need of Reformation. It is true, that in ſome Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Churches the cuſtome of daily Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions ſtill continued; but in many places they were ſo ſmall that the Canons did not think it worth their while to attend for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a Profit. <hi>Luca Biſantio,</hi> a poor Prelate but a good man, Biſhop of <hi>Cataro</hi> in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> was for obliging the Canons by Cenſures and Deprivation of Profits to be punctual in attending Divine Service. But the Council was of opinion rather to convert ſome of the Prebends into daily Diſtributions, that ſo the profit and advantage might engage the Canons to attendance. The other Points
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99003:211"/>were alſo examined, and met with no great difficulty, but were regulated as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Pope is alarmed at the Attempts of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and is diſtruſtfull of his Legates.</note>When the news of what had paſt at <hi>Trent,</hi> came to the Pope. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was much ſtartled, both at the heats wherewith the point of the Divine Right of Reſidence had been debated; and at the vigorouſneſs of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in aſſerting the Liberty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The Pope began to be Jealous of and to diſtruſt his own Legates; particularly the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who was ſuſpected not to be firm enough to the intereſts of the Holy See: The Pope likewiſe had ſome high words with <hi>de Vargas</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus Legatis.</hi> The Ambaſſadour repreſented to him, that if the Clauſe had been barely, that <hi>the Legates ſhould propoſe,</hi> this would not have excluded the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates from the liberty of propoſing alſo: but that that <hi>proponentibus Legatis</hi> in the Ablative caſe, as Grammarians ſay, imported an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all others. The Pope anſwered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully, that he had ſomething elſe to doe than to mind <hi>cujus generis &amp; caſus,</hi> that he was no Grammarian, and that theſe terms were ſincerely and without prevarication em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to expreſs his thoughts. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he continued firm in his reſolution to alter nothing in that Clauſe, and endeavoured by ſome excuſes to put off the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had declared, that he did not take it well that words ſo prejudicial to the liberty of the Council ſhould have been inſerted in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. The Point of Reſidence was conſulted at <hi>Rome</hi> in ſeveral Congregations of Cardinals
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:99003:211"/>and Ambaſſadours; they ſaw very well into the conſequences of that opinion which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have had aſſerted: and the Cardinals who held Biſhopricks knew that to oblige them to Reſidence by the Law of God, was the way to rob them of their Benefices, ſeeing they always attended at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But, which is more than all, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> perceived very well that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhops was to make themſelves abſolute over their Flocks, and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Holy See. However the Pope diſſembled that he knew any thing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Biſhops, and acted as if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion had onely been about obliging the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to Reſidence. And therefore having well weighed the matter, he declared that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>erved it to himſelf, that he would iſſue out a Bull enjoyning all Biſhops to Reſidence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of loſing their Biſhopricks: that he alone had the Power of putting the Laws of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in execution by that command that was given to St. <hi>Peter, ſeed my Sheep,</hi> and that after all, it was no great matter on what Right Reſidence was founded, whether Divine or Eccleſiaſtick, provided it was obſerved. At the ſame time he reſolved to give an anſwer to the Letters which he had received from <hi>Trent:</hi> And wrote, in effect, that he intended no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on the Council, but that it might enjoy the liberty that it always had, provided the Council owned him for its Head, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that reſpect which is due to the Holy See. Some conſultation there was about ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other Legates, and recalling the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Mantua;</hi> but they durſt not, becauſe
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:99003:212"/>of the great reputation of probity that he had acquired. The Pope was in good hopes that he would himſelf deſire liberty to lay down, when he found how ill they were ſatisfied with him. In the mean time that he might by all means ſecure himſelf againſt the deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon his Authority, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſolicited the <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to deal with their Maſters, that they would order their Miniſters who were at <hi>Trent</hi> to ſtand up for the Authority of the Holy See. For obtaining the favour of the King of <hi>France</hi> and of the <hi>French,</hi> he promiſed to make the King a preſent of an hundred thouſand Crowns, and to lend him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand more. And at the ſame time he diſpatched to <hi>Trent</hi> a freſh recruit of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops who were at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might in ſome meaſure counterbalance the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction.</p>
                  <p>The Legates having received the Pope's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, proceeded according to the inſtructions that were ſent them from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The thirteen Articles of Reformation propoſed by the Legates were reduced to nine in making of the Decree; becauſe with conſent of the Prelates the Legates had ſtruck out thoſe which concerned Clandeſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; and of their own head or by Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> cut off that which related to Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The Decrees were read in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, where the omiſſion of the Article of Reſidence raiſed a new tumult and made a great noiſe, but it came to no Head; for the Legates having made ſome bald excuſes that did not take, refuſed with Authority to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99003:212"/>with that point at preſent. At length the fourteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the day appointed for the Seſſion came; wherein nothing was done, but the Prorogation of the Seſſion to the fourth of <hi>June.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seſſion. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </note> The Marqueſs <hi>de Peſcara</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Spain</hi> made great inſtances, that in that Seſſion the Council might be declared to be a Continuation of that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Julius;</hi> but the Emperour's Ambaſſadours oppoſing it with the ſame vehemency, nothing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therein. Immediately after the Seſſion the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> parted from <hi>Trent</hi> under pretext of going to give orders about the affairs of his Government; but in reality to ſhun Competition with the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> who was ſhortly to arrive. In effect, two or three days after <hi>Lewis de S. Gelais,</hi> Lord of <hi>Lanſac</hi> chief of the Embaſſie arrived, and was followed ſome days after by <hi>Arnold Ferrier</hi> Preſident of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Guy Favre Sieur de Pibrac,</hi> who was alſo a gown man.<note place="margin">Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pope and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and of the Fathers of the Council among themſelves.</note> Miſunderſtandings grew daily more and more betwixt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Council, for amongſt other things that troubled the Pope, he was vexed at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> becauſe he had not complied with the intentions of the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who urged that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Council might be declared to be a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the former. The Emperour who was informed of thoſe freſh inſtances of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had ſent orders to his Ambaſſadours to leave the Council ſo ſoon as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould have obtained the Declaration which they demanded; and the Pope imagined that that claſhing would have broke up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:99003:213"/>which was the thing in the world he moſt deſired; ſo that he complained of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that he had joyned with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the point of Reſidence, and had oppoſed them in the matter of the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Council; which made it apparent that he was always engaged in oppoſite inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to thoſe of the Pope; and therefore it was brought into conſultation a ſecond time, whether the Cardinal ſhould be called home, or at leaſt a new Collegue ſhould be ſent him, to whom the chief inſtructions ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt. On the other hand the Council at <hi>Trent</hi> was as little ſatisfied with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was with the Council; ſo that there was nothing but Diſcontents every where; for even in the Council moſt part of the Prelates were diſſatisfied with one another, and many times came to big words. About this time the Biſhops of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poccio</hi> having had a little Debate in an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Prelates; the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> asked the Biſhop of <hi>Capoccio</hi> how many Souls he had committed to his Care; he made anſwer, five hundred, whereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that as man to man he was willing to yield to him, but when they acted in name of thoſe they repreſented, he that ſpoke onely for five hundred Souls ought not to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal to him who ſpoke for five hundred thouſand.</p>
                  <p>This was the State of Affairs, when the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France,</hi> who arrived ſome time before, were received into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the twenty ſixth of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:99003:213"/>The <hi>Sieur de Pibrac</hi> made a ſmart and bold Speech; he condemned the indiſcreet and ill weighed Zeal of thoſe that would yield nothing for peace-ſake, and by ſtanding up for the Church even to the meaneſt Ceremonies give occaſion to Schiſm.<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours are received they make Speeches, and receive no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> He complained pretty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly of the violence that was put upon the Council, in denying it the Liberty which it ought to have; he blamed the later Councils which had been held ſome ages before, as wanting that courage and vigour which they ought to have had in withſtanding oppreſſion, and in remedying the Evils of the Church, and exhorted the Prelates to take a better courſe for reſtoring peace to Chriſtendom. Other Ambaſſadours at their firſt Audience made onely ſome Complements, ſo that there needed no preparation to make them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But this extraordinary Puſh of the <hi>French</hi> put the Council ſo off of the hinges, that the Promooter had nothing to ſay to them, and thus the Congregation concluded with that harangue. Next day the ſame Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours waited on the Legates to ſhew them their commiſſion; and demanded forthwith that the Council might be declared a new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and that theſe words might be ſtruck out of the Bull <hi>Indicendo continuamus, &amp; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ando indicimus,</hi> which contained an ambiguous Senſe unbeſeeming Chriſtians. But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance made no impreſſion, the Legates anſwering that their power did not extend to declare this Council to be a new Council, but onely to preſide therein, <hi>according to the Will of the Council.</hi> Theſe laſt words of the Legates anſwer were quickly ſpread abroad, and made
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:99003:214"/>the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay, that the Preſidents ſpoke in the Style of very humble Servants, but acted like very abſolute Maſters. Afterwards the <hi>French</hi> joyned with the Ambaſſadours of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to demand that in the next Seſſion the point of Reſidence which had been ſufficiently examined, might be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; they ſaid farther, that the King their Maſter expected that they would treat of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, before they entered upon Doctrines, that the Proteſtants ſeeing the Church refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, might more eaſily ſubmit to the Deciſions that ſhould be made in points of Doctrine. Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> anſwered cunningly as to the matter of Reformation, that it was a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult point, ſeeing it depended in part on the correction of the abuſes which Princes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in beſtowing of Benefices; and that he had a ſpecial regard to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who by virtue of a <hi>Concordat</hi> made betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> X. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. had the Nomination to all great Benefices, by which Canonical Elections were aboliſhed. This work ſpoken in ſeaſon ſtopt the Ambaſſadours mouths as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but it was not ſo eaſie a matter to ſtop them as to the point of Reſidence, the excuſe that the Legates made being evidently ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for they alledged that the matter had not been ſufficiently examined, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nothing was ever more; what the Legates reaſon wanted in force it had ſufficiently in Authority which gives weight to the weakeſt Arguments; ſo great was the ſharpneſs of contention that this matter occaſioned, that many of the Biſhops beyond the <hi>Alpes</hi> were

But the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, who ſaw that the Pope deſired no better than to have an occaſion to break up the Council, put a ſtop to that; they thought it more expedient to wave the points of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of the Continuation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, than to give an occaſion of a Rupture. Nevertheleſs the Pope, who earneſtly ſought for an opportunity of diſſolving the Council, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to declare, according to the deſire of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that that Aſſembly was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Council of <hi>Paul</hi> III. and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> III. that he might thereby give occaſion to the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to proteſt and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. He therefore ſent orders to his Legates to make that Declaration, which troubled them extremely. They had had much adoe to prevail with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> not to inſiſt any more on that particular, and they could not tell how they could handſomely come off with it. They therefore ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> Cardinal <hi>Altemps</hi> the Pope's Nephew, to inform him of the State of Affairs, and to take him off of that reſolution which would doe great Damage to his Reputation, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the diſſolution of the Council.</p>

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:99003:216"/>and that they ſhould not have the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the Laws of God; that it ſhould not be lawfull to excommunicate any but ſuch as were notoriouſly guilty of mortal Sin; that Divine Service ſhould be celebrated in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage intelligible to the People; that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not contained in Scripture ſhould be left out of Miſſals and Breviaries; that Prieſts and Monks ſhould be reformed according to the ſtandard of the ancient inſtitution; that ſomewhat of the Rigour of Poſitive Laws ſhould be abated; and that in ſome places the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meats, Lent, and the Celibat of Prieſts ſhould be aboliſhed: And theſe were the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal heads of their demands. The Legates deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if poſſibly they could, to have ſuppreſt that Piece which they looked upon as terrible: and therefore they gave the Ambaſſadours a fair and ſoft anſwer, that theſe matters could not be moved in the next Seſſion; but that they would lay hold on an occaſion to diſcourſe them with the Fathers of the Council. This anſwer gave no ſatisfaction to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours: and therefore they ſent the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> by Poſt for new inſtructions, that he might make all haſte and be back again before the next Seſſion. The Legates on their part alſo thought fit to acquaint the Pope with what paſt, and diſpatcht to him <hi>Leonardo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lanciano;</hi> he had orders to pacifie the Pope, and Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> who were much diſlatisfied with the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and particularly with the Cardinal of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua:</hi> but the Anxiety of the Pope was doubled when he ſaw the Propoſals of the <hi>Germans;</hi> he well perceived that the Emperour, in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of having his Son elected King of the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:99003:216"/>
                     <hi>Romans,</hi> liad a deſign to gain the Proteſtants; he dreaded the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Prelates who were to joyn with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and made no doubt but that they would offer bolder Propoſals and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial ſtill to his Authority. And this made him ſeek out Pretexts for raiſing of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that ſo he might be in a condition to maintain his Grandure by the Arms of the Fleſh, if the Arms of the Spirit did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with him. His deſign of oppoſing the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> who troubled the County of <hi>Avignon,</hi> afforded him a very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pretext. Under that colour then he levied four thouſand <hi>Switzers,</hi> and three thouſand <hi>German</hi> Horſe; part of them he ſent to <hi>Avignon,</hi> and furniſhed the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with money to arm for the ſame cauſe. At the ſame time he endeavoured to form a League amongſt the Miniſters of the Princes that were at the Council againſt the Proteſtants; but no body would conſent to it, all the Princes excuſing themſelves upon particular accounts; but uſing this reaſon in general, that it would be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Continuation of the Council. That laſt reaſon weighed not much with the Pope; for the Rupture of the Council, which the Princes ſo much feared, was the thing that he moſt deſired; and therefore he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed once again in Conſiſtory the deciding of the Debate about the Continuation of the Council according to the intention of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> thereby to vex the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and force them to withdraw. In the mean while he complained continually of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he was uſed, and ſaid that <hi>Lanſac</hi> ſeemed rather the Ambaſſadour of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>

He accuſed <hi>Lanſac,</hi> of having ſaid that ſo many <hi>German</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Biſhops would come, as ſhould be ſtrong enough to drive the Idol from <hi>Rome.</hi> He found no leſs fault with the Cardinals of <hi>Mantua, Seripando</hi> and <hi>Warmia</hi> his Legates, ſaying that they deſerved not to wear the Hat of a Cardinal. He ſent <hi>Carlo Viſconts</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> with Orders to watch over their proceedings, promiſing him a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Cap at the firſt promotion, wherein he was as good as his word. He gave him a liſt of thoſe who were faithfull to the Holy See, that he might converſe freely and open his heart to them. <hi>Viſconte</hi> faithfully diſcharged his Commiſſion, and was a very exact Spie in the Council, giving the Pope an account of the leaſt thing that happened there, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Simoneta</hi> had given the Pope advice that the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> had engaged himſelf by an expreſs promiſe to bring the Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence into play again, this made him break out into an open paſſion, and he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been tranſported into ſome raſh action, had not the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lanciano</hi> arrived very opportunely, who acquitted himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary well of his Commiſſion in juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cardinal. He preſented to the Pope a Letter ſigned by more than thirty Biſhops, who proteſted to his Holineſs that they had not the leaſt deſign to leſſen his Authority by
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:99003:217"/>demanding that Reſidence might be declared to be of Divine Right. That calmed him a little, and diſpoſed him to receive more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the excuſes of the Cardinals of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, Seripando</hi> and <hi>Warmia;</hi> ſo that by the pains of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lanciano,</hi> the Pope became more moderate, wrote to the Legates in a ſofter Style, and acquainted the Fathers that he deſired the Council might be free, that he was not againſt the deciding of the Point of Reſidence, but that they muſt wait till the heats and animoſities were over. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar he gave orders to tell the Cardinal of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> that he was ſatisfied with his innocence, and that with much Joy he acknowledged it. Poor <hi>Camillo Oliva,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Secretary, had no ſhare in his Maſter's recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the Pope; for after the death of the Cardinal, as that faithfull Servant waited on his Corps to <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Pope upon idle and ſilly Pretexts cauſed him to be put into the Inquiſition, where for many years he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red inconceivable miſery.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Divines give their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the Demand of the Cup which the <hi>Germans</hi> made.</note>During this time the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were employed in examination of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which were to be decided in the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Congregations began the ninth of <hi>June,</hi> and continued untill the three and twentieth. Threeſcore Divines were heard upon the Point of the Communion in both kinds: but that being a Point of Antiquity for the knowledge of which School-Divinity was of little uſe, they came very ill off about it. They all agreed that the Cup was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and endeavoured to prove, that from the very times of the Apoſtles dry Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:99003:218"/>had been in uſe, becauſe there is often mention made of breaking of Bread, without ſpeaking any thing of Wine. They proved the ſame Communions without the Cup alſo, by the Communion of the Laicks, which is frequently mentioned in the writings of the Ancients; when any Member of the Clergy fell from his Poſt, he was turned off to the Laick Communion. Now, ſaid they, ſeeing that Communion of Laicks is diſtinguiſhed from the Communion of the Clergy, it muſt needs have been different; and that difference could be no other but this, that the Clergy communicated in both kinds, and the People onely in one. A little more knowledge in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity would have taught them that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Laicks was not different from that of the Clergy, but onely in Order and Place; for the Clergy received in the Chancel and before the People, and the People afterward <hi>extra cancellos,</hi> in the Body of the Church. Moſt of their other Arguments wee diſliked by the knowing men, becauſe they urged them without choice or diſcretion. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſome would make it out that it was not neceſſary to take the Cup, becauſe <hi>Jonathan</hi> took onely a little honey on the end of his ſtick, and that his eyes were cleared without having drunk. But amongſt all theſe able Diſputants, no man was more remarked for the Singularity of Argument, than <hi>James Paiva Andradius;</hi> he alledged that our Saviour gave the Communion to his Diſciples in Bread alone, whilſt they were yet Laicks, which proved that the Bread belonged to all the Laicks; but that having given them the Bread, before he
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:99003:218"/>gave the Cup, he ordained them Prieſts, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> At length, he gave them the Cup, ſaying, <hi>drink ye all of it:</hi> whence it is clear, ſaid he, that the Cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to the Prieſts. <hi>Anthony Mandol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi> a Divine belonging to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> having proteſted that he was of the ſame opinion with the reſt, did nevertheleſs quite overthrow all the Arguments which they had drawn from Scripture and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He demonſtrated, that dry Communions were unknown to Antiquity, and that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence no other Authority could be alledged for them but the Council of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> which muſt be ſubmitted to, and the Point taken as decided, that Communion under both kinds is not neceſſary; but that that was not the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hand, the matter now under examination being whether the Cup might be rendered to thoſe that deſired it; to the handling of which he thought they ought to proceed, and paſs by the other. <hi>John Paul,</hi> Divine to the Biſhop of the five Churches Ambaſſadour for the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> was of the ſame mind, and concluded that the Cup might be reſtored; but neither of them were favourably heard, ſince what they ſaid was eaſily ſeen to be the Dictates and Inſtructions of their Maſter. The handling of the third Article propoſed by the Legates raiſed ſome noiſe; the ſubſtance of it was that they who onely received the Bread were not deprived of any neceſſary Grace. For there were ſome that did not agree to that, but maintained that he who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Cup receives more abundant Grace. One Friar <hi>Amant</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Servite,</hi>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:99003:219"/>Divine to the Biſhop of <hi>Sebenico</hi> in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> went farther than all the reſt, and ſaid that according to the Doctrine of Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> the Bloud is no part of ſubſtance of Man's body, but merely an Aliment; and that ſo the Bloud was not neceſſarily in the Fleſh by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance, ſeeing it does not follow that a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt of neceſſity be always accompanied with its Aliment. He added that according to the words of our Saviour, <hi>drink, this is my Bloud,</hi> that Bloud muſt have been out of his Veins, becauſe Bloud running in the Veins could not be drunk. This reaſoning raiſed a Tumult, a claſhing of Hands, and ratling of the Benches amongſt the Divines; which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Diſputant not onely to be ſilent, but to recant, ſaying that it had eſcaped him in the heat of the Diſpute. And thus, in ſpight of all oppoſition, the Concluſion of the Debate was, that he who did communicate in one kind reaped as much Benefit as he who received in both. Nevertheleſs, to give ſome ſatisfaction to thoſe who maintained that there was more Grace conveighed in receiving both the ſigns, it was thought fit to have it inſerted, that a Believer was not deprived of any Grace that was neceſſary to Salvation. And this might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that one was deprived of ſome ſaving Grace, though it was not of abſolute Neceſſity. But the fourth Article occaſioned great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, and was thus couched: <hi>Whether the reaſons which had obliged the Church to allow the Bread alone to the Laicks, did ſtill hinder the granting of the Cup.</hi> For the Prelates and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Divines had conſpired in a wonderfull Union, not to ſuffer the Cup to be reſtored to any Nation
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:99003:219"/>They made uſe of all the reaſons that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Church to forbid the Cup, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that they were in force ſtill. With much affectation they aggravated the danger of Effuſion, and urged how unſafe a thing it was to change a Practice eſtabliſhed in the Church, ſince Hereticks would draw great advantages from thence. Some of them either ignorant in Antiquity, or confident and raſh, pleaded that the Church did prohibit the Cup for confuting the Errour of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who did not believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was wholly and intirely under one of the kinds, adding that ſince that Errour was broached again by modern Hereticks, they ought to retain the Practice which ſerved to confound that Hereſie. What a groſs and foul imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence was this? For the Cup was not retren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Age of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> nor did ever that Heretick maintain any diſpute about the Real Preſence. From Reaſons they came to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and flew ſo high as to call all thoſe, who demanded the Chalice, Hereticks. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Portugueſe Jacobin</hi> called <hi>Franciſco Forier,</hi> thinking to make himſelf remarkable by a piece of wit, ſaid that Princes who deſired the Cup for their Subjects, had a mind by the Councils leave to turn <hi>Lutherans.</hi> This was lookt upon as an inſolent expreſſion, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the Emperour. <hi>Franciſco de Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuit ſaid with leſs wit but more Paſſion, that the Devil did here transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light, and that under colour of deſiring the Bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he ſet the People on to demand a poiſoned Cup. God Almighty was at leaſt as much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:99003:220"/>by the extravagance of the Jeſuit, as the Emperour was by the inſolence of the <hi>Jacobin:</hi> but the Jeſuit could defend his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Authority of Cardinal St. <hi>Angelo</hi> great Penitentiary, and of the Pope himſelf; for not long before theſe words had been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Rome</hi> in a Congregation of Cardinals in preſence of the Pope, who paſt it by very well, and was not at all troubled at it. The <hi>German</hi> Divines did, indeed, raiſe a counter-Battery, but the Party was not equal, for there were but very few <hi>Germans,</hi> and a great many <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Council. It is true, there were ſome Divines of other Nations more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, who, in a Spirit of Charity, were for allowing the Cup to thoſe that demanded it, under certain conditions; nay and ſome were ſo condeſcending as to think it might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abſolutely and without any reſtriction.</p>
                  <p>The Point of the Communion of Children was onely added to ſwell up the bulk of the matters that were to be decided in the Seſſion, that it might not ſeem to have done but little, and therefore it occaſioned no diſpute, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing that it was not neceſſary. When the Decrees came to be drawn up, the Legates were inclineable enough to have ſatisfied the <hi>Germans</hi> in granting them the Cup, under the conditions propoſed by <hi>Paul</hi> III. and therefore in a Congregation of Prelates which was held after the Congregations of the Divines were over, they were for paſſing by the fourth Point which concerned the granting of the Cup, and for framing Decrees upon the reſt, reſerving this till another time that they had prepared the Council to admit of it. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:99003:220"/>ſuſpecting that, made a great ſtir, and under Pretext that matters muſt be done in order, they would by no means proceed to the fifth Point untill the fourth were adjuſted. This cauſed ſome diſorder and bitterneſs among the Prelates, which obliged the Preſidents to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the Aſſembly without doing any thing. Theſe abrupt breakings up of Aſſemblies were very frequent,<note place="margin">The way that Cardinal <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneta</hi> made uſe of to break up the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, when matters went contrary to his intentions.</note> and Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> with his addreſs and cunning was the cauſe of all theſe Confuſions, when he perceived that matters went not according to his mind. This Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was intruſted with the greateſt Secrets of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and was the chief of the Pope's penſionary Biſhops who were not a few, and who had orders to ſtand by him. He had pickt out ſome of the wittieſt and boldeſt of them, as the Biſhops <hi>della Cava</hi> and <hi>Capo d'Iſtria, Zambeccari</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sulmona,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomeo Serigo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſtellanetta;</hi> who when they found that matters went croſs to the intentions of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> they interrupted thoſe that were giving their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by raillery, and turning their reaſons into ridicule. This never failed to occaſion Debates, from Debate they fell into Paſſion, and ſo all withdrew without concluding any thing.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadour of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had been now two Months at <hi>Trent</hi> in quality of a private Perſon, becauſe of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of having Precedence before the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour who would not give him the Place. At length, he received Orders from his Maſter to yield, and was publickly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Congregation of the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> having made his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:99003:221"/>that his condeſcenſion at preſent was onely for the ſake of Peace, and not to the prejudice of his Maſter and the other Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> He made a very long and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry free Speech, wherein he complained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely of the Corruption of the <hi>German</hi> Clergy, and of the Concubinage of the Prieſts; and enumerating the evils which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon the retrenching of the Cup, he urged hard that it might be reſtored to the People, and demanded that Prieſts who had a mind to Marry might be diſpens'd from their obligation to a ſingle life. The Council by the mouth of their Promooter gave him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpot a very civil anſwer. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours took this ill, and complained that the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with as great liberty as they, he had been, notwithſtanding, civilly anſwered, whereas their Speech had been refuted in a ſharp and unbecoming manner. The Emperour's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours finding themſelves backt by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians,</hi> thought it time to oppoſe the violence of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who could not endure the demand of the Cup for the People. They therefore drew up a Memoir upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which, after the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had ſpoken, they preſented in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. In that Writing they urged that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> and Pope <hi>Julius</hi> had been ſenſible of the neceſſity of granting the Cup to thoſe who demanded it; that it was the onely way to retain the <hi>Calixtins</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in the obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that in <hi>Hungary</hi> the People did already conſtrain the Prieſts to give them the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:99003:221"/>in both kinds, by ſeizing their goods and threatning to kill them; and that to anſwer thoſe who in ſo haughty a manner deſired to know who they were that demanded the Cup, they gave them to underſtand, that it was the Emperour himſelf.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> joyn with the <hi>Germans</hi> in the Demand of the Cup.</note>In the Congregation of the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> preſented a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tending to the ſame end; that is to ſay, that they joyned with the <hi>Germans</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Cup. They pleaded that in matters which are onely of Poſitive Right too much rigour is not to be uſed, and that it is good to comply with the weakneſs of thoſe of whom we have the conduct. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction ſtartled the Legates, who were afraid that things would not ſtop there. They were pretty well inclined to reſtore the Cup to the <hi>Germans,</hi> but they had no mind that it ſhould extend to <hi>France</hi> alſo. Beſides the Pope's Party was alarmed at the reaſons alledged by the <hi>French,</hi> that in matters which are onely of Humane conſtitution a latitude ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; this ſeemed a very ſuſpicious Propoſal from the Mouth of the <hi>French,</hi> who ſtretched that Poſitive Right to a great compaſs. In effect: <hi>Lanſac</hi> the chief of the Embaſſie, let ſlip ſome words in a great entertainment that he had been at ſome days before. He hinted that the <hi>French</hi> wiſhed that Divine Service might be allowed them in the vulgar Tongue, that Prieſts might have liberty to Marry, and that Images were taken out of the Churches: ſo that the Legates were of opinion, that for that time it was not convenient to meddle with the Point of reſtoring the uſe of the Cup.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:99003:222"/>They treated about that in private with the <hi>Germans,</hi> and at length brought them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that it might be referred to another Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and the <hi>French</hi> who ſtickled not much for it, did not oppoſe the deſign: but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> perſiſted to ſhew the averſion they had to the demand of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> However the Biſhop of <hi>Lerida</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> did not ſeem to be altogether againſt it; for giving his opinion in the Congregation of the ninth of <hi>July,</hi> after that he had profeſt that he was not of the mind that the Cup ſhould be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the People, he added that there might be ſome words inſerted in the Decree for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to the <hi>French</hi> the privilege of giving the Communion in both kinds, if they thought good: that in that caſe the <hi>French</hi> might doe as other Nations did, and amongſt others the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who did partake of the Cup by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an expreſs privilege, granted them by Popes, which he ſaid, he had ſeen. After the Congregation was up, <hi>du Ferrier</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours preſſed the Biſhop of <hi>Lerida,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Antonio Agoſtino,</hi> very hard to tell him, what Pope it was who had granted that privilege to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in both kinds.<note place="margin">The ignorance of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</note> The Biſhop made him anſwer that it was Pope <hi>Damaſus.</hi> This made <hi>du Ferrier,</hi> who was well Skill'd in antiquity, laugh, and confirmed all People in the opinion that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are very ignorant therein. For <hi>Damaſus</hi> lived about the end of the fourth Century, when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was very far from giving the Cup by way of Privilege, ſince for more than a hundred years after, to abſtain from it was by her lookt upon
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:99003:222"/>as Sacrilege; as appears by the Deciſion of Pope <hi>Gelaſus,</hi> which is inſerted in the Decree of <hi>Gratian.</hi> In the Congregation of the tenth of <hi>July, Leonard Haller</hi> Titular Biſhop of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> moved, that it was neceſſary to ſtay for the <hi>Germans,</hi> as a few days before <hi>Daniel Barbaro</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia</hi> had demanded that they might ſtay for the <hi>French,</hi> to the end that the Council might be called General, as being made up of all Nations; for there were none but <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> in it; and theſe <hi>Italians</hi> almoſt all of them the Pope's Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who moſt cunningly ſtood up for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> There were even ſome that ſaid publickly enough, that that Council was not the Council of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, but of the Pope, ſince he did in it what he pleaſed: and theſe were thoſe who had ſpoken with ſome freedom as to the Point of Reſidence. The Papal Party had a great pique againſt them, which appeared ſo plainly, that they did not think themſelves ſecure enough even at <hi>Trent:</hi> and therefore they thought of withdrawing, ſome of them had already obtained leave; amongſt whom were <hi>Egidio Foſcararo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Modena;</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Viviers, Acqui,</hi> and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Surriento.</hi> But the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugal</hi> having repreſented that that would do hurt to the reputation of the Council, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of their departure was generally known, they were detained by fair promiſes of better uſage for the future. However there was no notice taken of the demand that was made of waiting for the coming of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Prelates. In the following
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:99003:223"/>Congregations the Chapters of Reformation were read, and ſome Biſhops ſpoke with a great deal of liberty. As to the Point of free Ordinations the Biſhop of <hi>Vegla</hi> an Iſland near <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> ſaid that it would be to no purpoſe to lay a reſtraint upon ordaining Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops not to take money, if at the ſame time it were not Decreed that no fees ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Rome</hi> for Diſpenſations to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out of the uſual times, and before the Age appointed; that the greateſt expence was there, and that the ſmall gratuities given at Ordinations was nothing to it. He farther ſaid that when any ſuch Diſpenſations were preſented to him, it was his cuſtome to ask if they had coſt any money; and that if he found they had been bought, he rejected and did not value them. As to the Point concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe that got into Prieſts Orders without a ſufficient Eſtate to maintain them, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the five Churches ſpoke with great freedom, that it was of much more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to prevent a mans entering into Orders without having a Church and Cure to ſerve, than to hinder him upon the account of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Eſtate, and that it was very diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Church to have prieſts who had no other Employment but to live idly and take their eaſe upon a good fat Benefice. In one of the Articles of Reformation it was ordained that great Pariſhes ſhould be divided into two, that they might be the better ſerved: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſame Biſhop ſaid, that that was good, but that it was much better to divide the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, which are of ſo great extent, that it is not poſſible for one man to take the care
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:99003:223"/>of ſo many Souls. Theſe opinions pleaſed no body, neither the Prelates nor the Preſidents. Afterward the Biſhop of <hi>Sidonia</hi> an <hi>Hungarian</hi> took the boldneſs to ſay that all theſe petty Reformations of the Members of the Church ſignified nothing, ſo long as the Head conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without Reformation; that it behoved them to begin with the greater matters, and that the leſſer would paſs without any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This liberty was very offenſive to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and therefore they met to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout means of repreſſing that boldneſs. <hi>John Baptiſta Caſtello,</hi> Promooter of the Council, who had diſcharged the ſame office in the Council under <hi>Julius</hi> III. ſaid that the courſe muſt be taken which had been uſed by Cardinal <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio,</hi> who enjoyned the Prelates ſilence when they did in the leaſt deviate from the Subject that had been propoſed. But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> did not approve that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and affirmed that God had not bleſt the Council of <hi>Julius</hi> becauſe he approved not thoſe violent methods of Cardinal <hi>Creſcentio;</hi> that after all, it was impoſſible to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts in Councils. The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> was of the ſame Judgment. So that they thought it ſufficient to limit every one to a certain time in ſpeaking, and to make it ſhort, that ſo they might not have leiſure to ſpeak many things which might give diſguſt. The day for holding the Seſſion which was the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>July,</hi> drew nigh; and the <hi>Germans</hi> who had conſented that nothing ſhould be moved in it about the permiſſion of the Cup, demanded now a great deal more, and urged that nothing might be done at all, that ſo they
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:99003:224"/>might give time to their Biſhops to come. The Legates to prevent the diſgrace of being ſo long without doing any thing, would needs have the Chapters of Doctrine and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which had been minuted, to be publiſhed: And they muſt be read overagain in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, before they could be publiſhed in the Seſſion; which was not done without debate. In the ſecond Chapter of Doctrine theſe words were ſlipt in, that the Church might as well take away the uſe of the Cup, as it had changed the form of Baptiſm. <hi>Jacobo Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto de Nogueras</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aliphe</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſtarting up ſaid, that that was Blaſphemy, becauſe the Church had no Power to change the form of Sacraments, nor to alter any thing that is eſſential to them, and that in effect the form of Baptiſm had never been changed; that hint was taken notice of, and the Clauſe left out. In the third Chapter it is ſaid, that he who is barred from the Cup is not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of any Grace neceſſary to Salvation, and that therefore the Church has Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench it. The Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> one of the Legates ſet on by ſome Divines obſerved as to that, that thence it might be inferred that the Church may wholly take away the Euchariſt, becauſe it is not neceſſary to Salvation, and deſired ſome alteration in that Clauſe. But Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> being vexed at what had paſt in the Congregation told the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia,</hi> that he had very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſuffered himſelf to be put upon in making that Overture, and that if he would everlaſtingly give ear to thoſe Doctours accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the cavillings of the School, nothing could
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:99003:224"/>be concluded in the next Seſſion. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> ſubmitted, excuſing himſelf in that what he had done was deſigned for a good end. In the Congregation that was held the day before the Seſſion, there happened ſome Debates ſtill, as in all the reſt: but they were not very conſiderable, and continued not long.</p>

                        <item>4. That the Communion of Children is not neceſſary.</item>
                     </list> In all this no notice was taken of the queſtion, whether it was expedient to allow the Cup to People that demanded it, becauſe that point was reſerved for another Seſſion, as they had promiſed the <hi>Germans,</hi> and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by a Decree referred to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Seſſion, which is inſerted in the Acts of the Council. The nine Chapters of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were alſo read. The firſt ordains, that the Collation of Orders, the Dimiſſorial and Teſtimonial Letters, the Seal and other things of that nature ſhall be given <hi>gratis,</hi> without ſo much as taking any voluntary offering. The ſecond, that no man ſhall receive Orders
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:99003:225"/>if he have not a Benefice, or at leaſt an Eſtate of his own to ſubſiſt on, which Eſtate is not to be alienated without the conſent of the Biſhop. The third, that in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, where there are no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, or where they are but ſmall, the Biſhop may convert a third of the Prebends into Diſtributions. The fourth, that in great Pariſhes the Curates ſhall take the aſſiſtance of a ſufficient number of Vicars, and that ſuch as are of too large an extent ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and provided with new Rectours, if that be judged neceſſary. The fifth, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops may make Unions to perpetuity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices that have cure of Souls; when they are not ſingly ſufficient for the Subſiſtence of a Curate. The ſixth, that Curates who are negligent in their Duties, ſhall have Vicars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them whether they will or not, and that part of the profits of the Living ſhall be allotted to theſe Vicars, and that if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates continue in Scandal, they ſhall be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Benefices. The ſeventh, that the Biſhops as Delegates of the holy See, may annex the Benefices of decayed and demoliſhed Churches, to other Churches, and cauſe Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches to be repaired. The eighth, that the Biſhops alſo as Delegates of the holy See, may viſit Monaſteries that are <hi>in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum,</hi> to ſettle the obſervation of Diſcipline therein. And the laſt Chapter aboliſhed the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectours or Alms-gatherers. Theſe Collectours were a ſort of men who under Pretext of ſome pious work, as the building an Hoſpital for the Sick, the bringing up of Orphans or the like, obtained Letters of Recommendation from the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:99003:225"/>Biſhop, and with theſe Letters run over a whole Countrey to gather Collections under the notion of Almſdeeds. Some of them alſo obtained a Licence from the Pope, that they might not be hindered by the Biſhops in their Collections. This cuſtome had degenerated into a horrid abuſe, in that theſe Collectours treated with the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> that part of the purchaſe ſhould be brought thither, nay and it was even ſpecified in the Bull how much the Collectour was to keep for himſelf, and how much he was to pay out; ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly was that Corruption tolerated. Of theſe gatherings a very ſmall portion was employed in the charitable Work which ſerved for a Pretext, and the reſt went into the Pocket of the Collectours, and of thoſe that had got them the Privilege. Many time alſo they who obtained from <hi>Rome</hi> Patents to empower them to gather Charity, farmed out their right to the off-ſcourings of the People, who, to make the moſt of their Farm, by a thouſand damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tricks frightned the People out of their wits and money. They put themſelves into ſtrange Antick dreſſes, and carried about with them bells and other tinckling inſtruments, preached up counterfeit Indulgence, and denounced a thouſand Evils to thoſe who refuſed them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, and theſe were the Collectours that were then aboliſhed. This was all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of eight whole Months labour, during which nothing was to be ſeen but Couriers without intermiſſion poſting from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> and from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> continual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Negotiations, and Conferences betwixt the Ambaſſadours of all the Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:99003:226"/>and the Legates, not to mention the infinite number of conſultations and deliberations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Prelates, who were four times more in number, than they were in the two firſt Convocations of the Council. Theſe great Engines having wrought ſo little, People could not forbear to apply the Proverb, <hi>Parturiunt montes, naſcetur ridiculus mus.</hi> The diſcontented and thoſe profeſſed Criticks that ſtand in awe of no Tribunal, made their obſervations, that there was no great need of meeting at <hi>Trent</hi> to blaſt the Memory of the Fathers of the Church by deciding a queſtion concerning the Communion of young Children, in ſuch a manner as made the Judgment of the Ancients Hereſie, who would have Infants immediately after Baptiſm to receive the Communion: and particularly they could not but condemn that Decree as abſolutely unneceſſary, becauſe now-a-days no body laboured to introduce the cuſtome again. But the leſs cenſorious could not forbear to mark a great want of Judgment in the ſecond Canon, which under Pain of an <hi>Anathema</hi> condemns thoſe that will not believe that the Church had good reaſon to retrench the Cup. All men wondered that that refuſing of the Cup being lookt upon as a matter of Humane Right, ſince by a formal Decree of the Council it was left in ſuſpence, whether it ſhould be reſtored or no, ſhould notwithſtanding be decided under <hi>Anathema,</hi> as a matter of Divine Right that the Church had reaſon in refuſing it.<note place="margin">Matters are prepared for the following Seſſion, and the Preſidents are reconciled.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Seſſion being over, the Legates thought fit to prepare matters for the next: but the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> judged it abſolutely neceſſary to make
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:99003:226"/>the Cardinals of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Simoneta</hi> friends, before they proceeded any farther. For this reconciliation the Pope imployed the Mediation of Cardinal <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Uncle to the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and of <hi>Alexander Simoneta</hi> Brother to the Cardinal of the ſame name: both of them wrote ſo effectually to their Relations, that the peace was made, and the Sunday after the Seſſion <hi>Simoneta</hi> dined with the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua.</hi> They conſulted together what means were to be uſed to ſatisfie the Pope as to the Point of Reſidence, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as to the Demand he made that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Council might be declared a Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former. But to extricate them out of theſe Difficulties a Letter came very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which ordered the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> not to inſiſt any more for having the Continuation of the Council declared, provided all words that might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that it was a new Council were avoided. The ſame Letter gave orders to acquaint the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates, that the King commended their Zeal in making ſo many inſtances for having Reſidence to be declared of Divine Right, but that it was not convenient for the preſent that that queſtion ſhould be decided. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> chief of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not very well ſatisfied with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, but however it cooled his heat a little.</p>
                  <p>The twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> a Congregation was held to begin the preparation of matters to be decreed in the next Seſſion: The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> made a Speech to the Prelates to perſwade them to ſpeak their opinions calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:99003:227"/>and in ſew words, telling them that the Preſidents had made orders to prevent Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Congregations of the Divines. Theſe orders appointed the number of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that were to ſpeak, to wit, four for the Pope, three for every Ambaſſadour, for the Legates one of their Domeſticks, and for every Religious Order three who ſhould be choſen by their General: And to ſatisfie thoſe who ſhould not be choſen to ſpeak; it was ordered that they might communicate to the Legates their mind in writing. But one order was made that would have thoroughly vexed thoſe Spokeſ-men, had it taken effect; and that was that no Divine ſhould ſpeak above half an hour, and that he might be interrupted by the Preſidents if he ſpoke any longer. In the ſame Congregation the Legates propoſed the matters which were to be examined, and they reſolved to handle the Sacrifice of the Maſs,<note place="margin">The matter of the Sacrifice of the Maſs is choſen.</note> and the abuſes committed therein. The matter had been already examined in the Council of <hi>Julius,</hi> and therefore the Cardinal <hi>Seripando,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> were of opinion that they might be ſhort about that, and paſs by a great many conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, ſince hardly any thing remained to be done, but to review and publiſh what had been already minuted upon that ſubject, but their advice was not followed. This head was divided into thirteen Articles, wherein were comprehended all the controverſies about that Subject, which are at this day argued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Proteſtants: to wit, whether the Maſs be a Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, whether it derogates from the Sacrifice
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:99003:227"/>of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whether <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by ſaying <hi>doe this</hi> hath appointed the Sacrifice of his Body, whether private Maſſes be lawfull and good, whether it be lawfull to celebrate Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the honour of Saints, whether the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Maſs are good and holy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be Errours in the Canon of the Maſs, whether the words of Conſecration ought to be pronounced with a low voice; with ſome other queſtions of leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours ſtayed at the Council with very little ſatisfaction, for they ſaw that matters of higheſt moment were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be handled without expecting, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of their Nation; and ſo all things would be carried by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and the <hi>Italians.</hi> They therefore wrote to the King that he would haſten away the Biſhops of <hi>France;</hi> that they durſt not hitherto propoſe any point of Reformation, becauſe they had no body to ſecond them; that the Pope was abſolute Maſter of the Council; that the door was barred againſt all propoſals tending to Reformation by the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi> that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was Miſtreſs of all Deliberations as well as Propoſitions, by the great number of Penſionary Biſhops that the Pope entertained at the Council: and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had ſhews ſome Zeal for Reformation were cooled by orders which they had received from their Prince. They conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that having conſidered all theſe things, there was but little to be expected from that Council. Next day after that firſt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they fell to work. Two Jeſuits, <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:99003:228"/>Salmerone</hi> and <hi>Franciſco de La Torre</hi> the Pope's Divines ſpoke firſt, and made nothing of the half hour Regulation; for <hi>Salmerone</hi> took up the whole time of the Congregation. Next Morning the Jeſuit <hi>de La Torre</hi> did as much, and neither of them in thoſe long diſcourſes ſaid any thing that was remarkable: towards the end, the Jeſuit <hi>Torre</hi> ſaid that the paſſage of St. <hi>John, if ye eat not my Fleſh and drink not my Bloud, ye can have no life in you,</hi> could not be underſtood but of the Sacramental Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Divinity did not pleaſe the Legates, becauſe the contrary ſeemed to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the firſt Chapter of Doctrine of the former Seſſion: but eſpecially becauſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation inferred the neceſſity of the Cup; for if our Saviour in that place ſpeak of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Manducation, and that without drinking his Bloud in a Sacramental way, it is impoſſible to have life, it is clear that the Cup is neceſſary: for the Bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not drunk Sacramentally, but in taking the Cup. Theſe were two turbulent Jeſuits, they had already made a clutter the very day of the laſt Seſſion, about the firſt Chapter of Doctrine; wherein they would have had it more expreſly defined, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had not inſtituted the Sacrament in both kinds but onely for the officiating Prieſt, and not for the reſt. And that diſpleaſed the Legates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ill timed. Beſides that, the Jeſuit <hi>de La Torre</hi> in particular was not well liked of by Cardinal <hi>Simoneta,</hi> for all he was a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and the Pope's Divine, becauſe he had written againſt <hi>Catarino</hi> for the Divine Right of Reſidence. And in fine, the Legates took it
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:99003:228"/>very ill that they had ſo inſolently violated the half hour Regulation; ſo that they reſolved among themſelves to curb that Sauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the future.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Great Debates about the Queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> offered himſelf when he inſtituted the Euchariſt.</note>When the Examination of the Points came to the Vote, all the Divines agreed to condemn the opinions of the Proteſtants, and enlarged very much in proving the Maſs to be a true Sacrifice. They alledged all the Arguments that are uſed at this day: <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>'s Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, the Type of the Paſchal Lamb which repreſented the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, the pure oblation ſpoken of in the Prophecy of <hi>Malachi,</hi> and all the other Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are made uſe of for that purpoſe. But a great Debate aroſe upon occaſion of this Argument: one of the Diſputants affirmed that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was Sacrificed in the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, and that afterwards he had ſaid, <hi>doe this,</hi> that is to ſay, doe this that I have done, whence it was manifeſt, ſaid he, that our Lord commanded us to ſacrifice, and therefore that the Maſs was a Sacrifice. There were a great many others who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrary, and that our Saviour was not then ſacrificed. This Queſtion, whether our Saviour did ſacrifice himſelf in the firſt Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, was not ſet down among the Points that were to be examined, but Providence permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be occaſionally ſtarted; and nothing could happen more luckily to ſhew what till then the Sentiment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was concerning the nature of the Maſs. No man of common Senſe ought to doubt but that our Lord by theſe words, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> gave no other Command to his Diſciples,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:99003:229"/>but to doe preciſely that which he himſelf had done; for it is evident that theſe words, <hi>doe this,</hi> ſignifie, doe that which I have juſt now done, ſo that it is a matter of the higheſt conſequence to know what it was that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did, that is to ſay, whether he ſacrificed himſelf in the inſtitution of his Supper; for if he did not ſacrifice himſelf, neither did he command that he ſhould be ſacrificed. They who held that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſacrificed himſelf, maintained that it was abſolutely neceſſary to aſſert that truth, becauſe the chief Argument of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks againſt the Sacrifice of the Maſs, was that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not ſacrifice himſelf in the Euchariſt. But the oppoſite Party proved by irrefragable Arguments that our Saviour could not have ſacrificed himſelf in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. They affirmed that the Maſs is a Sacrifice of Commemoration of the Sacrifice on the Croſs, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not as yet ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the Croſs, when he inſtituted the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and that ſo he could not make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative Sacrifice of that which was not as yet come to paſs. They farther urged that neither the Canon of the Maſs, nor the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor the Fathers ſpoke any thing of our Lord's having ſacrificed himſelf. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly they ſaid, that either the Sacrifice of our Lord in the Euchariſt was Propitiatory or not; if it was Propitiatory, that then the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſs was needleſs, becauſe the Sins of Mankind were expiated by the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt: and that if that was not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, neither can this be, ſince it is the ſame that our Saviour offered.</p>

                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:99003:229"/>In the Congregation of the twenty fourth of <hi>July,</hi> it came to the turn of the Divines of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to ſpeak. One of them named <hi>Ataide</hi> took a <hi>Medium</hi> to prove the Sacrifice of the Maſs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ataide</hi> a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all the Arguments drawn by the others from Scripture for the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and departs.</note> which ſurpriſed many, for he overthrew all the Arguments taken from Scripture: in examining the ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages he evidently demonſtrated, that nothing could be concluded from them to prove that the Maſs was a Sacrifice; he reſumed alſo all the reaſons of the Proteſtants, and ſet them off in their full force, and, in fine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Sacrifice of the Maſs was built upon no other Foundation but Tradition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It may eaſily be imagined how this diſcourſe was taken: And therefore <hi>James Paiva An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dradius</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Divine alſo did what lay in his Power to make amends for that fault; he recapitulated all the Proteſtant Arguments that were propoſed by <hi>Ataide,</hi> and anſwered them, aſſuring the Council that his Collegue had onely propoſed them, with deſign to have them refuted. The Ambaſſadours and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Prelates endeavoured likewiſe to juſtifie him to the Legates: Nevertheleſs within a few days after he left <hi>Trent,</hi> and it is no hard matter to gueſs at the reaſon of it. Amongſt the laſt Divines that ſpoke was <hi>Antonino Da Valtellina</hi> a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> who was not of opinion that the Council ſhould confirm by Decree the Ceremonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged much to prove that there had been always great Diverſities of Ceremonies in the Church.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:99003:230"/>the different Liturgies of St. <hi>James,</hi> of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> He mentioned alſo the <hi>Mozarabick</hi> Service heretofore in uſe in <hi>Spain,</hi> into which Horſes and <hi>Moresk</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing were brought in as Ceremonies ſignifying great Myſteries. <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. aboliſhed that Service, but even at the time of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it was ſtill in uſe on certain days, and in ſome certain places of <hi>Spain.</hi> He therefore concluded that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremonies were eſtabliſhed by Decree, it was to condemn thoſe Ancient Churches, who uſed not all thoſe Ceremonies. This diſcourſe highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Council; but the Biſhop of the five Churches ſeconded him, and affirmed that they who condemned what he ſaid, were ignorant. The truth is, it was his concern to have that opinion paſs, that ſo under Pretext of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Ceremonies, he might not be denied that which he had demanded for <hi>Germany,</hi> I mean that the <hi>Germans</hi> might not be obliged to follow the Ceremonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, particularly the want of the Cup, and the uſe of the Latin tongue in Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>When the Congregations of Divines had made an end, the Biſhops aſſembled for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Decrees; but the ſame Difficulties that were ſtarted amongſt the Divines, aroſe likewiſe in the Congregations of the Prolates. <hi>Martin Perez.</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Segovia</hi> who had been in the Council which was held under <hi>Julius,</hi> was of opinion that nothing was to be done; but onely to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> what was then digeſted concerning that controverſie. Cardinal <hi>Seripan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> was not of that mind; but alledged that the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:99003:230"/>Canons and Decrees which had been framed at that time might expoſe the Doctrine of the Church to calumny, and might give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Hereticks; becauſe they were long inſtructions which give occaſion to long refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and againſt which the Hereticks find always means to make troubleſome exceptions: that to correct what had been done, was not the way, but that the Council muſt ſet to work a freſh to adjuſt the matters; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was followed. They therefore fell to the making of new Decrees, but they found it no eaſie task to pitch upon the reaſons that ought to be inſerted in the Decree for confirming the Sacrifice of the Maſs, ſome approving one reaſon, and others rejecting it. Cardinal <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pando</hi> one of the Legates, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> were on their ſide who ſaid that it ought not to be put into the Decree that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſacrificed in the firſt Euchariſt. And on the other hand, the Cardinal of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> was for them who would have that Clauſe to be inſerted; and this cauſed a great deal of Debate, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the Congregation of the thirteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Proxies of the Biſhops of <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> were received. The City of <hi>Baſil</hi> was reformed and owned not their Biſhop, giving him onely the Title of Biſhop of <hi>Poren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truto;</hi> but the Council ſtrove to doe him the greater honour, that they might comfort him for the loſs of his Biſhoprick. And this being done, they fell again upon the point of the Sacrifice of the Maſs. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciano</hi> was of opinion that for ending all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences they ſhould paſs by the Chapters of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:99003:231"/>Doctrine, and onely make Canons with <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>'s, as the Council had already done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Points of Original ſin, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general, and the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. <hi>Ottaviano Preconio</hi> Archibiſhop of <hi>Paler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> ſpeaking next oppoſed what had been ſaid, ſhewing that they ought not to omit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Doctrine of the Church, nor the reaſons which confirm it, for fear of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, becauſe what courſe ſoever were taken, they would never be quiet; but that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks ought to be inſtructed. That point was canvaſſed for ſeveral days; and at length it was concluded to proceed as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and to make Chapters of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd.</note>Whilſt theſe Diſputes about the Sacrifice of the Maſs were on foot, the Champions for the Divine Right of Reſidence were not aſleep: they reſolved to have another tug at it, and began again with freſh inſtances to urge the performance of the promiſe that had been made them of deciding that controverſie, and pronouncing ſentence thereupon. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates followed the inſtructions they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Rome</hi> by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciano,</hi> which were, not to oppoſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> openly, but ſlyly to pack Votes and caſt them by Plurality. They laboured therefore under hand to draw Biſhops over to their ſide, that there might no more mention be made of Reſidence. The <hi>Italians</hi> were eaſily corrupted, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> united more cloſely to oppoſe that caballing, and could by no means be gained. They wrote to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> an anſwer to the Letter which he had ſent them at the ſolicitation of the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara.</hi>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:99003:231"/>They complained of the Pope's procedure in making ſo great oppoſitions againſt the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Point of Reſidence. They gave him to underſtand that the Council was not free, that it was enſlaved by the Legates and Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Biſhops, and prayed his Majeſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult wiſe men about the matter, who would adviſe him without doubt, to protect the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick opinion of the Divine Right of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The Legates now found that no ground was to be gained upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſince neither the Letter of their Prince, nor all the ſubmiſſions that had been uſed to gain them, could work any effect upon them. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to take the ſureſt courſe they could: for that end they ſent a Copy of the Letter which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had written to the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> to the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> Legate in <hi>France,</hi> that he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the like from the King of <hi>France</hi> to his Ambaſſadours, to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from joyning with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And at the ſame time they wrote to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govia</hi> the two leading men of the Party for Reſidence, who ſeemed ſo untractable in a Point that his Catholick Majeſty did not at all concern himſelf in, had promiſed their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages to the Biſhop of the ſive Churches for allowing the Cup to the <hi>Germans,</hi> contrary to the intentions and ſentiments of their King.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand the Pope uſed all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſecure himſelf from any damage that he might be in danger of from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; he went on to raiſe Soldiers, he negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a League betwixt the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:99003:232"/>himſelf; he wrote to his Legates to ſtifle the matter of Reſidence, and that if after all, they could not hinder the proſecution of it, they ſhould ſo bring it about that the affair might be referred to him, and above all things that they ſhould labour to put a period to the Council before the <hi>French</hi> came, and before the ſitting of the next Diet in <hi>Germany,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he foreſaw that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Proteſtants might engage to make new Propoſals to the Council of more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence than the former. As the Pope on the one hand intended ſpeedily to put an end to the Council, ſo on the other hand, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours made it their buſineſs to prolong it, that their Prelates might have time to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore having by word of mouth made ſeveral inſtances to that purpoſe, they gave in a Memorial wherein they repreſented the neceſſity of expecting the <hi>French</hi> Prelates, that ſo the Council might be reckoned General, and be received in <hi>France.</hi> They promiſed that they ſhould arrive about the end of <hi>September</hi> at fartheſt, and deſired that the Seſſion might be put off. But the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates made anſwer, that that could not be; that they had been expected ſix months al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that the other Prelates ſuffered too much by that delay. The <hi>French</hi> were vexed at that anſwer, and deſired leave to make their Propoſals to the Council aſſembled in Congregation. The Legates refuſed it, ſaying that it was ordered that the Ambaſſadours ſhould treat onely with the Legates, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak in publick but the day of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And this renewed the grievances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99003:232"/>the Bondage of the Council. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> joyned with the <hi>French,</hi> and ſaid that they muſt ſee that Decree that was ſo much talkt of, which hindered Ambaſſadours from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Council: that if there were any ſuch, yet after all, it ought not to be regarded, ſince it was contrary to the practice of all the ancient Councils. The King of <hi>France</hi> gave alſo orders to his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> to preſs the Pope to enjoyn the Council to ſtay for his Prelates. The Pope referred himſelf to his Legates, the Legates remitted it to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and it was not permitted to ſpeak to this Council, to which all things were referred. <hi>Lanſac</hi> obſerved very well, that that was a fooling with his Maſter, and with the World And thus, notwithſtanding all the endeavours that were made for obtaining a delay, they fell to work again the Eleventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to review the matter of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, in order to the Decrees, and ſtuck again at the Queſtion, whether it ought to be put into the Decree that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ſacrificed in the Euchariſt. The Aſſembly was divided into two parts which were for a long time equal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James Lainez</hi> General of the Jeſuits arrived the fourteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and created no ſmall trouble to the Council, becauſe he would not be ſatisfied with the place that was aſſigned him after all the other Generals of Orders, upon Pretext, that the Society is an Order of Regular Prieſts, and that Regular Prieſts ought to goe before the Monks. The Jeſuits <hi>Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>La Torre</hi> uſed all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to procure him the Precedency. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:99003:233"/>his name was ſet down after all the other Generals of Orders. At the ſame time <hi>Pibrac</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours left <hi>Trent,</hi> and his departure gave the Legates a great deal of Jealouſie, who were afraid leſt ſome thing might be done in <hi>France</hi> againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Pope and Council. Cardinal <hi>Simoneta,</hi> one of the Legates, ordered one of his Confidents to inſinuate himſelf cunningly into <hi>Lanſac,</hi> and get out of him, what the meaning of that Journey was. <hi>Lanſac</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>Pibrac</hi> was gone about his own affairs, but that there was no doubt, but that he would complain of a Council where matters went ſo ill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Means uſed to cauſe it to be defined that our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf in the Euchariſt.</note>Congregations were continued untill the Eighteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> about the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the queſtion ſtill depending, if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was offered up in Sacrifice in the firſt Euchariſt. <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jeſuit held the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, and laboured tooth and nail to get his opinion ratified. He prevailed with the Cardinal Legate of <hi>Warmia</hi> to doe things on that occaſion that might be called violent Actions. This Jeſuit went from houſe to houſe to ſolicite Votes, making promiſes to ſome, and threatning others; which was done ſo publickly, and in ſo importunate a manner, that in the Congregation of the Eighteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Chioza</hi> and <hi>Veglia</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it, and this laſt ſpoke againſt the opinion of <hi>Salmeron</hi> with ſo much force, and backed his Sentiment with ſo many reaſons, that he brought over almoſt all the Aſſembly to his Judgment, which was, that it ought not to be ſaid in the Decree that our Saviour ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:99003:233"/>himſelf when he inſtituted the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. The ſame day the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> who went from <hi>Trent</hi> ſome days before, came back with Letters from the Emperour to the Legates, wherein he prayed them, that they would put off the handling the Point of the Sacrifice of the Maſs untill the Diet of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> was over, and that in the next Seſſion they would diſcuſs the matter of the Cup, which the <hi>Germans</hi> deſired. The firſt Point was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe it muſt needs be diſpatcht what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever came on't; but they granted the ſecond, becauſe the Pope being ſolicited by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had written to his Legates, that they ſhould treat of the matter of the Cup to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the <hi>Germans,</hi> and to clear buſineſs as faſt as they could. <hi>Lainez</hi> General of the Jeſuits was the laſt that ſpoke to the Queſtion, to wit, whether our Saviour was ſacrificed in the Euchariſt; and he took up the whole time of a Congregation maintaining the affirmative. But notwithſtanding all theſe long Harangues and Canvaſſings, the opinions were ſtill almoſt equal. At length the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the day, and the Legates reſolved that it ſhould be expreſſed that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Euchariſt, but that the words, <hi>in Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> ſhould be left out, and onely mentioned that the Lord was ſacrificed. So that the Difficulty was not removed; for the Proteſtants ſtill demanded, was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> offered in Propitiatory Sacrifice in the Euchariſt or no? if the Sacrifice was not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory; then that of the Maſs is not, for the Lord ſaid <hi>doe this,</hi> doe that which I have now done: if it be Propitiatory, then the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:99003:234"/>Sacrifice of the Croſs was not, ſince that the Propitiation being made in the Euchariſt, the Sacrifice of the Croſs had nothing to doe. It is alſo obſervable that their opinion was not condemned who affirmed that neither the Scripture, the Canon of the Maſs nor the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaid any thing that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſacrificed himſelf. So that it is certain that it was the current opinion before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that the firſt Euchariſt was not a Sacrifice, and that it was onely the fear of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that the Proteſtants might draw from thence which obliged the Council to change that opinion.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the Biſhop of the five Churches the Emperour's Ambaſſadour ſpoke,<note place="margin">The reſtoring of the Cup to the <hi>Germans</hi> as moved.</note> and in name of his Maſter repreſented the neceſſity of reſtoring the Cup in <hi>Germany,</hi> without which it would be impoſſible to keep that People united to the Church, and prevent others from falling off from it. He ſaid that if the diſmembring the States of the Empire were ſuffered, there could be no reſiſtance made againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> who continually lay hovering over it. When he had ſpoken he preſented a Memorial, wherein he declared the manner how he deſired that matter might be managed; but a murmurring of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing, the Aſſembly was thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. In the Congregation of the third of <hi>September</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours renewed their inſtances for a delay of the Seſſion four or five Weeks longer; but the Legates had lately received Letters from Cardinal <hi>Ferrara</hi> Legate in <hi>France,</hi> which informed them that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:99003:234"/>and twenty <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctours were to come; and, as other Letters imported, that their deſign was to handle the Superiority of a Council over the Pope, and that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> intended to take from the College of Cardinals the power of chuſing the Pope. This news allarmed the Legates, and made them deſire that the Council might be ended before the coming of that Company; and therefore they were far from granting the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours the delay which they demanded. So it was refuſed, and the Legates diſguiſing the true reaſons of it, gave the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours the ſame anſwer that they had had before, but <hi>Lanſac</hi> not ſatisfied with that, complained onely of the little regard that was had to the Demands of his Maſter. In oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>French</hi> a writing went about at that time, wherein it was aſſerted that the Council could not long ſubſiſt at <hi>Trent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Month of <hi>September</hi> there would be a want of Proviſions there. But the true reaſons why they would grant no delay was imprudently enough thrown out, for, ſaid they, if we muſt wait for the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> the Council will not onely be free, but wholly Libertine.</p>
                  <p>The Legates therefore made all the haſte they could in forming the Decrees; and that of the Sacrifice of the Maſs being in a pretty conſiderable forwardneſs, they propoſed the matter of the Cup, whether or not it might be granted to the <hi>Germans.</hi> There were three opinions as to that, one that it ſhould in no manner of way be granted, nor upon any conditions; another that it might be granted
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:99003:235"/>under certain conditions; and that was the opinion of fifty of the beſt Heads of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who were for commiſſionating men upon the places, to judge of the neceſſity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what conditions it might be proper to grant it according to the different diſpoſitions of the people. The third opinion was, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be referred to the Pope; ſome that he might abſolutely refuſe or grant it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that he might allow it according to his Prudence. All the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were inflexibly for refuſing the Cup, for fear leſt it being granted to ſome Nations, it might occaſion commotions in the Low-countries, and the Territories which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had in <hi>Italy,</hi> for obtaining the ſame privilege their neighbours enjoyed. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Prelates fet on by their Ambaſſadours were for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, upon the ſame account of neighbourhood to <hi>Germany.</hi> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> who, though a <hi>Spaniard</hi> had engaged himſelf to the Biſhop of the five Churches to give his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage for the Cup, durſt neither declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf openly to be againſt what he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor yet give his Vote contrary to the will and intereſts of his King. So that he went about the buſh, and concluded that it was an affair that could not be decided that Seſſion, becauſe the deciſion of it depended on ſeveral circumſtances of place, and the humours of the People. He nevertheleſs confeſſed that the ſtreſs of the matter was no more but a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony which might be changed by reſtoring the Cup to the People, if the union of the Church required it. <hi>Gaſparo de Caſal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liria,</hi> though a <hi>Spaniard</hi> alſo, gave his Vote
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:99003:235"/>for the conceſſion of the Cup, and ſome <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Biſhops favoured the <hi>Germans</hi> demand; amongſt others <hi>Don Bartholomè</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Braganſa,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conimbre;</hi> but this laſt added his reaſons, that they to whom the Cup was allowed ſhould abjure Hereſie; that they ſhould profeſs the belief of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and the Concomitance, that they ſhould baniſh Heretical Preachers, that they ſhould not keep the Chalice, and that it ſhould not be carried to the Sick; that that conceſſion ſhould not be made openly in Council, but by the Pope's Legates being upon the place, that ſo it might be done with leſs ſhew and ſcandal. It came to the Biſhop of the five Churches turn again to ſpeak as a Prelate, he refuted all that had been ſaid againſt the conceſſion of the Cup. He ſhew'd that the Council of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> had retained the <hi>Bohemians</hi> in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, onely by granting them the Cup. He affirmed that the <hi>Calixtins</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> communicating in both kinds, were ſtill very good Catholicks, that they had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> for their Superiour, and prayed him to ordain their Prieſts. The laſt Congregation that was held upon that Subject was on the fifth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:99003:236"/>it: it was not doubted but that he was one of thoſe, whoſe ſeditious principles, as they called them, tended to ſubject the Pope to a Council. The Legates were confirmed in their thoughts, becauſe this Abbot was ſeen to goe often to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours; and it was known that he preſſed them to haſten the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their Prelates; nay in ſome former Congregations ſpeaking of the Sacrifice of the Maſs he had ſaid by the bye, that he doubted whether the Pope was above a Council or not, and had promiſed to ſpeak his mind freely as to that, when the queſtion came to be handled. The Legates thought it not fit that ſuch a man ſhould ſtay in the Council; and therefore they ſought an opportunity to make his General recall him upon ſome plauſible pretext. But there was no need of that, for he was uſed in ſuch a manner as vexed him into a fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereof he died the ſix and twentieth of <hi>November</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>The Prelates gave their opinions at large concerning the demand of the <hi>Germans;</hi> but beſides what we have mentioned, there was not any thing conſiderable in all they ſaid; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the diſcourſe of <hi>Peter Danez</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lavaur,</hi> who ſpoke with much freedom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who would refer the matter to the Pope. He ſaid that the Pope had referred the affair to the Council, and that for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to ſend it back again to the Pope, was to play at faſt and looſe; that after all, he could not tell under what Character they conſidered the Pope, in remitting the buſineſs to him, whether as Superiour or Inferiour to the Council; that the Pope muſt be obliged to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:99003:236"/>act very differently, according to theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Characters; and that therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the firſt place to diſcuſs the queſtion of the Superiority of a Council over the Pope. This diſcourſe netled the Pope's Party; and amongſt ſo many different opinions the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were exceedingly perplexed. They ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſerious in their intentions to ſatisfie the Emperour about the conceſſion of the Cup; but they could not find means to doe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the multitude of oppoſers. So that they reſolved at length, to get out of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars by referring the matter to the Pope, and cunningly brought about part of the Biſhops who were againſt the conceſſion of the Cup, and amongſt others the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to conſent to it.<note place="margin">The matter of the Cup is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Pope.</note> The Biſhop of the five Churches yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo; but he deſired that a Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be made amongſt the Acts, and that it ſhould be ſpecified in that Decree, that the Council had thought it convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Cup, and that they referred it to the Holy Father to determine to whom, and upon what conditions it ought to be done. He obtained indeed a Decree of Reference, but not that it ſhould be inſerted in it that the Council judged it convenient to reſtore the Cup. In fine, he ſuffered himſelf to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deſiſt his Inſtances, at leaſt till ſuch time as the Heats were a little over.</p>
                  <p>And this affair being in ſome meaſure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, they ſet about the finiſhing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Maſs. The Jeſuits <hi>Lainez, Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and <hi>de la Torre,</hi> by means of the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> one of the Preſidents, whom they had gained to their opinion, ſtarted new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:99003:237"/>and made freſh inſtances, that it might be expreſt in the Decree not onely that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was offered, but that he was offered in Propitiatory Sacrifice. There was a world of trouble to make them be quiet; and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that at every turn they ſtarted, had almoſt taken away all hopes that the Seſſion could be held on the day prefixt. But, at length, in the Congregation of the ſeventh of <hi>November,</hi> the Decree was agreed on in the form that it ſtands in at preſent: moſt part conſented to it; but the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> was none of that number; for he perſiſted in his opinion, that it ſhould not be ſaid that our Saviour offered himſelf in Sacrifice when he inſtituted the Euchariſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, were propoſed ten Articles of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation concerning Abuſes in the Maſs, and eleven others about ſeveral matters, all of them of very little importance; which obliged the Biſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>

                     <hi>John Suarez</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conimbre,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Segovia,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Oreate</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to complain, and ſay that the Council was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about trifles, that <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and all <hi>Europe</hi> had for an hundred and fifty years deſired a Reformation of the Church, in the Head and in the Members; that they ought to have begun with the Pope, proceeded to the Cardinals and Biſhops, and that the reſt would have been eaſily done afterward; but that what was now done was merely a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to Catholicks, and an occaſion of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Hereticks. The Biſhop of <hi>Oreate</hi> ſpoke freely, that a Declaration ought to be made that the Decrees of a General Council
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:99003:237"/>obliged the Head as well as the Members. That ſaying fell not to the ground, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently there was a great muttering among the Pope's Party, and the Biſhop thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to explain himſelf, and to ſay, that his meaning was that the Decrees ought to have a Directive but not a Coactive Power in regard of the Head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>There were not now above three or four days to the ſitting of the Seſſion, and yet a great deal of buſineſs to be done: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the important point about the Conceſſion of the Cup was not as yet fully adjuſted, and withall the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were ſtill urging a delay of the Seſſion. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> did ſo inſtantly preſs it, that the Pope was fain to tell him that he referred it wholly to the Council, that it was the buſineſs of the Fathers, and that it was no wonder if they refuſed delays; but that he was ready to write to <hi>Trent,</hi> that for his own part, he was content that they ſhould conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the delay which the <hi>French</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In effect he did write much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But Cardinal <hi>Simoneta,</hi> who knew more of the Pope's mind than was contained in the Letter, ſtood firm againſt a Prorogation, and carried it: for he was fully ſatisfied that the deſign of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was to put an end to the Council ſpeedily, and that the Pope had onely written that Letter to eaſe himſelf of the importunities of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and to load the Legates with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the <hi>French.</hi> When it was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the Seſſion ſhould not be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, the Chapters about the abuſes in the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:99003:238"/>Maſs, and the eleven Articles of Reformation were quickly diſpatched; nor did they find ſo much difficulty as they imagined, concerning the matter of the Cup. The Legates drew up the Decree of Reference, which imported that the affair was referred to the Pope, that with the advice and conſent of the Council his Holineſs might doe therein what he ſhould judge expedient. Becauſe thoſe words ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to intimate that the Council conſented, that the Pope ſhould reſtore the Cup to ſome People, if he thought fit, all who were for the refuſing of it, oppoſed the paſſing of that Clauſe, and the Legates as being out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wholly abandoned the matter. But the Emperour's Ambaſſadours who deſired that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms the Cauſe ſhould be referred to the Pope, becauſe they were confident of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining from him what they deſired, preſſed the Legates to leave out the Clauſe that was excepted againſt, and to propoſe the Decree a ſecond time. The Legates would willingly have done it, but becauſe of the ſhort time that remained, they foreſaw that if that affair were ſtated again, it would ſtill furniſh new matter of Debate, and that ſo the Seſſion muſt of neceſſity be put off. They therefore were poſitive not to ſpeak a word of that Decree; but the Ambaſſadours proteſted, that they would no more appear in any Congregation, or Seſſion, ſince they uſed the Emperour with ſo much contempt, untill they had informed him of all that had paſt, and received new Inſtructions from him. This Proteſtation obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Legates once more to propoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reference with the Amendments that
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:99003:238"/>had been made in it. And at length the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was carried by Plurality of Votes, though oppoſed by all that ſtood for the abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the Cup. And thus all things are now in a readineſs for the Seſſion which was to be held the morrow after.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> were indeed ſomewhat ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in that they had carried this Point, but on the other hand they were extremely diſpleaſed that there had been ſo little regard had to the Emperour's Inſtances for putting off the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Maſs till after the Diet of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; in which he hoped to obtain ſomething of the Proteſtants. And therefore ſeeing all things in a readineſs for the Seſſion, they aſſembled together into their houſe the <hi>French</hi> and all the other Ambaſſadours of Princes, except the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> who refuſed to come: In which Aſſembly the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the five Churches made a long Speech, and told them that hitherto the Council had been amuſed with matters of little Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that their whole buſineſs had been to make Deciſions which were good for nothing but to exaſperate the Proteſtants, neglecting the neceſſary work of a good Reformation; that all things were now in a readineſs for the next Seſſion; and no way left to prevent it; but that it behoved them at leaſt to take care for the future, that the Legates might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do the ſame, that therefore it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on them ſo to order Affairs, that in the ſubſequent Seſſion the Point of the Sacraments, or any other matter of Doctrine, ſhould not be handled, but onely the Reformation which all <hi>Europe</hi> ſo paſſionately deſired. The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:99003:239"/>of the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour oppoſed this opinion; for he feared that if the method of proceeding, which had been hitherto uſed, came to be altered, it might give occaſion to think that the Council was a new Council, and doe a prejudice to the King his Maſter's deſign who intended to oblige the Fathers before their ſeparation to declare, that this Council was a Continuation of the former: ſo that Doctrine and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having been always treated of joyntly, he would not conſent that the Council ſhould be moved to omit the matters of Doctrine, and apply themſelves onely to Reformation. And for this reaſon he withdrew, as alſo the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Switzers</hi> did. The reſt remained, and deputed <hi>Lanſac</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour to propoſe the matter in name of them all. He made the Propoſal to the Legates much to the ſame effect as hath been mentioned, but in ſofter terms, that he might give them no cauſe of offence. The Legates anſwered very civilly that it was the deſign of the Council to ſettle a good Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that what was already done was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what they intended to doe; but that it was impoſſible to alter the method which had been hitherto obſerved in treating of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Reformation joyntly; that it was in like manner impoſſible to put off the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe all the Fathers were weary of <hi>Trent,</hi> and it was not reaſonable to detain them and doe nothing. The Ambaſſadours made no reply; ſeeing they were juſt going to the laſt Congregation to adjuſt the Decrees. In that Congregation the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:99003:239"/>made freſh inſtances for a Prorogation of the Seſſion, but all in vain; the Decrees were read again, and new Debates, as was uſual began to be ſtarted about the Form, but the Legates found ways to keep all things in quiet.</p>

After that a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Cardinal <hi>Amulio,</hi> Protector of the Oriental Nations, was read in the Aſſembly. This Letter informed the Council that one <hi>Abdiſſi</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Muzal</hi> was come to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der homage to the Pope, had owned him for his Sovereign, and had received from him the <hi>Pallium,</hi> and Confirmation in his Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; that he had aſſured his Holineſs that the Religion of his People was in all things agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that it uſed the ſame Ceremonies, and that they had Books as old as the days of the Apoſtles At length he concluded that the People under the Juriſdiction of that Prelate, were ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that they reached beyond the River of <hi>Ganges,</hi> and that they were partly under the Dominion of the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Sophie</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and partly under the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> At this laſt word the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſadour ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and in his Maſter's name proteſted that the Oriental Biſhops ſubjects to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, acknowledged to Patriarch for their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. Afterward they read the Confeſſion of Faith of that Patriarch, and the Letter which he wrote to the Council, wherein he excuſed
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:99003:240"/>himſelf that he could not be there; becauſe of the great Journey he had already made, and was ſtill to make; but promiſed to ſubmit to all that ſhould be Decreed therein. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſadour made the truth of this ſtory to be much doubted. The Council came now to their Synodal Actions, and firſt was read the Decree of Doctrine containing nine Chapters, and as many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, eſtabliſhing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a perpetual Sacrifice, and the truth of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, as being really Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory. They confirmed the Ceremonies of that Sacrifice, the Purity of the Canon of the Maſs, the uſe of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of that Sacrifice, the Maſſes without Communicants, the Maſſes in honour of the Saints, and the mingling of Water with the Wine. To this Decree the Fathers gave their conſent by a <hi>Placet,</hi> except two or three and twenty, who perſiſted to oppoſe that Clauſe which ſays, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up himſelf in Sacrifice in the firſt Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> the chief of thoſe who diſliked that Clauſe, came not to the Seſſion, that he might not have the trouble to ſee a Doctrine paſs for an Article of Faith, which, in his opinion, was ſo repugnant to Truth. But the Legates ſent thrice for him, and at laſt forced him to come. This conſtraint put him into ſuch a fret, that he had a good mind to renew his oppoſition, that he might be revenged for the Contempt that was put upon him, in undervaluing his opinion: and it is ſomewhat ſtrange if he and ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates who brought along with them a ſpirit of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:99003:240"/>contradiction even to the Seſſion, ſhould all of a ſudden lay it aſide, and cloth themſelves with a ſpirit of humility and ſubmiſſion. So that it is clear that theſe Biſhops,<note place="margin">The Biſhops apparently ill ſatisfied with the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Council.</note> moſt of them <hi>Spaniards</hi> and ſtrict Catholicks, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding very ill ſatisfied with the Infallibility of the Council. Immediately after, the Biſhop who did officiate, read the Decree of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt the Abuſes committed in the Maſs; which prohibited, all treating and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining for ſaying of Maſſes; the ſuffering of vagabond Prieſts who were unknown or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly infamous to celebrate; the ſaying of Maſs in private houſes; to be preſent at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in an undecent habit; the uſing of laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Muſick in ſinging of Maſs; the making of noiſe, ſpeaking or walking in time of Service; the celebrating of Maſs out of the hours appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it; the celebrating with unuſual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; the having a certain limited number of Candles at Maſs; and for concluſion it contain'd an exhortation to the People to repair to Maſs in their own Pariſh Churches, at leaſt on Holy days and Sundays. In the next place the Decree of general Reformation was read, conſiſting of eleven Chapters, containing hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing worth the naming: onely ſome petty Regulations to hinder undeſerving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from being promoted to Biſhopricks. It is true that in ſome places the Decree ſeems to enlarge the Power of Biſhops, allowing them the Privilege to enquire into the nature of Diſpenſations, to wit, whether they have not been obtained by <hi>ſurreption</hi> or <hi>obreption,</hi> ſtealth or wheadling; to viſit Hoſpitals, Colleges, Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Publick Stocks for rellef of the Poor,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:99003:241"/>and to have the direction and overſight of all Pious Houſes and Foundations; but ſtill with this Clauſe of Limitation, <hi>as Delegates of the Holy See.</hi> The eleventh Chapter decrees, that whoſoever ſhall ſeize the Goods of Churches, Benefices, or publick Stocks of Charity, let him be King or Emperour, ſhall be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, untill he have made reſtitution, and that he may not be abſolved but by the Pope. Laſtly, the Decree of referring the matter of the Cup to the Pope was read; and ſeeing it was a Decree that related to a Point of Faith, it ought in courſe to have come after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Maſs; but it was otherways, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not get votes enough to make it paſs as a Point of Doctrine; it was an order of the Council that no Point of Doctrine could be eſtabliſhed, if a conſiderable Party oppoſed it, though it had been carried by Plurality of Votes; but that ſome caſting Votes were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a Point of Reformation: And the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates who were reſolved upon any terms, that the matter of the Cup ſhould be referred to the Pope, finding that they could not have Votes enough to make it paſs for a Point of Doctrine, thought it the beſt way to propoſe it as a matter of Reformation; and therefore it is placed in the Acts amongſt the Chapters of Reformation. This Maxime that we have been ſpeaking of, that a Point of Doctrine is not to be lookt upon as decided, when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Party oppoſe the Deciſion, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome Debates and Scruples, as to that Clauſe of the Decree, which aſſerts that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> offered himſelf in the Euchariſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been contradicted by a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:99003:241"/>Party; for though there were but three and twenty Prelates that oppoſed it in the Seſſion, yet it had been refuted by a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Congregations, and not one of them had changed his opinion.</p>
                  <p>The Decrees of this Seſſion gave but ſmall content to any: the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadours, indeed, were pretty well pleaſed, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the Cup was remitted to the Pope; but the Emperour himſelf was not at all ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, becauſe his great aim was to pleaſe the <hi>German</hi> People, who had no liking to the Pope's Jurisdiction. They would have much rather accepted a favour from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, a name they did not quarel with, than from the Pope, whom they could not endure. But the People were far more diſſatisfied; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Emperour's reaſon, they thought they were abuſed, in being remov'd from one Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature to another, ſeeing the Pope had refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the matter to the Council, and that the Council ſent it back again to the Pope. It was taken very ill alſo that in the Decree of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Power of Biſhops was extended to Pious Foundations, which had been ſetled by Lay-men, with intention that they ſhould be likewiſe governed by Laicks. They ſaid, that that was the way whereby the Clergy had appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to themſelves the Revenues of Colleges, Hoſpitals, and Pious Foundations; when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of being the Adminiſtratours, they made themſelves abſolute Maſters of them. Now-a-days, cried they, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to Colleges and Hoſpitals what the Church-men have taken from them, they put into their hands what remains, and what they

In the ſame manner they cenſured the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that gives Biſhops power over laſt Wills and Teſtaments: for that Decree or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains that Alterations made in Wills by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion obtained from <hi>Rome</hi> is not to take effect, untill the Biſhop have taken Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, whether or not the permiſſion has been obtained by fraud and upon falſe information. They thought Wills to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of mere Civil right, which the Clergy ought not to meddle in.</p>
                  <p>The Pope on the other hand was extremely well ſatisfied with the Actions of this Seſſion, and, indeed, he could not otherwiſe chuſe; ſince nothing had been done there, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſtructions and the Orders that the Preſidents had punctually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in ſpight of the oppoſition of all thoſe who favoured not his intereſts. He took the ſureſt meaſures he could for the future that matters might run in the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. He feared the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> knowing him to be a man of vaſt deſigns, and dreaded the coming of the <hi>French,</hi> who hold Maximes ſo contrary to his Authority. That Aſſembly of Ambaſſadours, who met at the Houſe of the Imperialiſts, gave him a great deal of Jealouſie; but he reſolved to ſend a freſh ſupply of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops to overpower the <hi>Tramontani</hi> by number as well as by caballing: And in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:99003:243"/>the mean time ſent very civil Complements to the Secretary of the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara,</hi> to the <hi>Portugal, Suiſſe, Venetian</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi> Ambaſſadours, for the Zeal and Fidelity they had expreſſed to the Holy See; which were not loſt, for by theſe Civilities he engaged them more and more to his Intereſts.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were no ſooner come from the Seſſion, than they received a Diſpatch from their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ordered them to make freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for a delay.<note place="margin">New Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours.</note> It was now too late, and therefore, according to the Inſtructions they had received, they demanded that at leaſt matters of Doctrine might be laid aſide, and onely Reformation handled, that the <hi>French</hi> might have time to come before all the Points of Doctrine ſhould be determined, ſeeing there remained no more to be diſcuſſed, but the Points of the Sacraments of Orders and Marriage, which would ſoon be examined; and then the <hi>French</hi> would onely come to the Cloſe of the Council; whereas the head of Reformation being very large, conſiderable
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:99003:244"/>progreſs might be made therein, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were on their way, and enough to doe after they were come. The Legates deſired their Demands in Writing, and the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours preſented them Memorials, wherein the King in ample manner approved all that had been done, as to the Deciſions about matters of Faith, but withall declared that he could not be ſatisfied that they proceeded with ſo much earneſtneſs and precipitation in matters of leſs importance, and did not mind that which was moſt neceſſary, to wit, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Manners and Diſcipline; which was the onely means of remedying the preſent Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Church; that theſe Deciſions of Points of Faith were, on the one hand, more than needleſs in reſpect of Catholicks, becauſe they were matters not controverted amongſt them; and, on the other hand, they did one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more alienate the minds of thoſe who were ſeparated from the Church, whom to reduce by ſuch means, was a ridiculous fancy. After all, becauſe the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the Council was no way conſiſtent with the Liberty of the Ancient Councils, where all had freedom to propoſe what they thought good for the Benefit of the Church; the King demanded that the ſame Liberty might be reſtored to the Council, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Kings and Princes who ſent their Ambaſſadours thither; and that ſo the Clauſe <hi>Proponentibus Legatis</hi> ſhould be ſtruck out. The Emperour's Ambaſſadours preſented Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als which demanded the ſame things, to wit, that they ſhould ſet about the work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with diligence; and that every Nation
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:99003:245"/>might have the Liberty to commiſſionate two Deputies to propoſe to the Council what might be thought neceſſary for the good of the Church. The Legates made the ſame anſwer to both, that they could not break off the Method that had been all along obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in handling matters of Faith and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, at the ſame time that they treated of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and that the manner of propoſing to the Legates what any one deſired might be handled, had been found ſo good, that it was not fit it ſhould be altered. The <hi>French</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed great diſſatisfaction at this Anſwer. They ſpoke openly of theſe new recruits of <hi>Italians,</hi> which were every foot ſent to the Council to thwart the deſigns of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> However the Pope did not lay ſo much ſtreſs on his <hi>Italians,</hi> but that he uſed all the other means he could to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> from coming to the Council. He ordered his Legate in <hi>France,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to ſpeak to him, and gave him intimation by other hands, that his coming to the Council would procure him no great Reputation, becauſe he would find all things there done to his hand.</p>

<list>
                        <item>1. Whether Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be a true Sacrament inſtituted by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                        <item>7. Whether the Prieſt be properly inferiour to the Biſhop; whether the Power of ordaining and confirming belongs not to the Biſhop alone excluding the Prieſt, and whether they who thruſt themſelves into the Miniſtry without Canonical Ordination are true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</item>
                        <item>8. Whether Biſhops eſtabliſhed and inſtalled by the Pope's Authority be lawfull, or whether it be neceſſary that they be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a Canonical manner.</item>
                     </list> The Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations about theſe Points began the twenty third of <hi>September,</hi> and were continued untill the ſecond of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of the four Congregations exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt two Articles: And all the Divines unanimouſly agreed, that Orders is a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For proof of this they brought the Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and firſt Verſe, (let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers,) <hi>quae ſunt à Deo, ordinata ſunt.</hi> This Argument
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:99003:246"/>is ſomewhat odd, as any man may ſee. But yet it is much odder, if you'll take notice that the ſtreſs of it reſts upon the diſtinction that was marked in the vulgar Latin, by a <hi>Comma,</hi> betwixt theſe words, <hi>quae ſunt à Deo,</hi> and thoſe other, <hi>ordinata ſunt.</hi> The Powers that are of God, are ordained, that is to ſay, according to the Gloſs of theſe Gentlemen, <hi>have received the Sacrament of Orders.</hi> For all that Gloſs, a man muſt be very ſharp-ſighted to ſee into the force of that Argument, and, indeed, to make good ſenſe of it. The opinions were not ſo uniform as to the ſecond Article, to wit, whether Orders be one or more Sacraments. <hi>Peter Soto</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> held that there were as many diſtinct Sacraments in Orders, as there are different Orders, to wit, ſeven; and for proof of that, he found in the Goſpel that our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> before he came to the Office of Prieſt or Sacrificer, had gone through all the Inferiour Orders, as of Chanter, Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, Porter, Reader, Deacon and Subdeacon, and that he had diſcharged all theſe ſeveral Employments. But the Hiſtory ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncouth to thoſe who had not read the Goſpel with ſo much attention as that honeſt Monk had. Another <hi>Jacobin</hi> called <hi>Girola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Bravo</hi> was not of that opinion, but after a long diſcourſe concluded that it ought not to be decided, that the ſeven Orders make ſo many diſtinct Sacraments, becauſe of the great diverſity of opinions that occur on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject amongſt the Divines and the ancient and modern Pontifical Doctours; he alledged it would be impoſſible to fix a ſolid Judgment, concerning the nature of Inferiour Orders,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:99003:246"/>not excepting even the Deaconſhip, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconſhip, becauſe of that variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He farther added that the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the leſſer Orders are ſteps to aſcend to Prieſthood, was not very ſure, and brought ſeveral inſtances from Antiquity of ſome who had diſcharged the Office of a Prieſt, without paſſing through the inferiour Orders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> unite to ſet forward the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note>When this Congregation was up, and the Prelates who had been preſent in it were gone, the Biſhop of the five Churches ſtayed behind in the Chamber, with ſome <hi>Hungarian, Poliſh,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates. He entertained them in diſcourſe, and earneſtly exhorted them to join together in the deſign of Reformation, to which the Legates would not hearken. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> then preſent made anſwer, and thanking the Biſhop of the five Churches for his exhortation, ſaid that he would aſſemble the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to conſult about it. In effect the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates did meet, and concluded that they ought zealouſly to beſtir themſelves for that Reformation, and that it was neceſſary to begin at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof was ſpread over all the reſt of the Church. They diſcourſed angrily of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that were daily committed upon the Authority of Biſhops; and <hi>Den Bartholomè</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Braganza</hi> added, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals muſt be brought back to their primitive inſtitution; that untill the tenth Century, they had been no more than ordinary Prieſts; that afterward they had riſen by degrees, though in the twelfth Century they had been ſtill inferiour to Biſhops; but that at preſent the Cardinals were ſo far above them, that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:99003:247"/>they thought they did Biſhops a great deal of honour, to admit them amongſt their domeſtick Servants. But above all things it was reſolved at that meeting that they ſhould urge Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy to be declared of Divine Right, and cauſe it to be defined that Biſhops held their Authority immediately from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not from the Pope. They found occaſion by the ſeventh of the Articles that had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to enter upon that queſtion: Becauſe the intent of that Article being to define that the Biſhop is Superiour to the Prieſt; it muſt be known by what Right he is Superiour, whether Divine or Humane. They were in hopes to get it defined that the Biſhop is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the Prieſt by Divine Right, and then they imagined that by degrees they might proceed to more important Propoſitions. They therefore choſe ſix of their number, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops, to digeſt into Order the Heads of Reformation which they ought to preſs. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Cordova</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> had almoſt ſpoilt all their meaſures, becauſe he kept intelligence with the Pope's Party, and gave them notice of the intentions of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> But for all that, the Archbiſhops of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Braganza</hi> made a Propoſal to the Legates that the Queſtion of the Authority of Biſhops and their Superiority over Prieſts might be brought upon the Stage again; a queſtion that had been heretofore propoſed in the ſame Council under <hi>Julius</hi> III. and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the affirmative that a Biſhop is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right; but becauſe of the Rupture of the Council, left among the Decrees not publiſhed. The Legates rejected that Propoſition, and ſaid
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:99003:247"/>that it was not a Controverſie betwixt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Catholicks; and ſo that it ought not to be medled with. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> anſwered, that it was the very thing which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> denied, that that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is betwixt a Biſhop and a Prieſt is of Divine Right, and derived from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they pretending that it is a mere Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitution. In this Debate, the Legates and Archbiſhop came to pretty high words, but he got no ground by it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore, reſolved to have the Propoſal made by their Divines; but on the other hand the Legates ſlyly raiſed a report amongſt the Divines, that that queſtion was laid aſide as not to be medled with.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt things proceeded in this manner, the ſecond Congregation conſiſting of Divines and Doctours of the Canon Law, examined the two next Articles, one whereof related to the Hierarchy, to wit, whether it be lawfull and holy, and whether the People and Magiſtrates have right to give their Votes for the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Paſtours. A Canon of <hi>Valentia</hi> called <hi>Thomas Daſſio</hi> ſpoke much, and uſed his utmoſt endeavours to prove.
<list>
                        <item>1. That without groſs ignorance in Antiquity it could not be doubted but that the Hierarchy was moſt holy and good.</item>
                        <item>2. That Epiſcopacy was an Order different from Prieſthood, becauſe the Biſhop has Characters eſſentially different from the Prieſt, as the Power to confirm, to confer Orders, and to make other Conſecrations which are peculiar to him, as that of the Oil, the Crimſon, and ſeveral others. He farther ſaid that it was ridiculous to make a Sacrament
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:99003:248"/>of the Office of a Porter, which was onely to ſhut a door, and might be very well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Lay-man, and to deny that honour to the Character of him who alone hath the Power of conſecrating Prieſts, and confirming Chriſtians.</item>
                        <item>3. That the ſimple Tonſure ought to be placed as the loweſt, and Epiſcopacy as the higheſt of Orders.</item>
                        <item>4. That heretofore the People had had a hand in chuſing the Members of the Clergy, but that it was by a Privilege from the Pope, who had afterward taken it from the Laicks, becauſe they had made bad uſe of it.</item>
                     </list> In find, he concluded that Ordination was ſolely in the Power of him that confers Orders: And therefore it was his Judgment that they ſhould not onely condemn the opinion of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> as Heretical, who will have the People to have a ſhare in the Call of Paſtours, but that thoſe places in the Pontifical which mention the Suffrages of the People in the Ordination of the Members of the Clergy, ſhould be left out; and amongſt the reſt this place, which expreſly ſaith, <hi>That it is not without reaſon that the Fathers thought fit that the Suffrage of the People ſhould intervene in the Ordination of the Miniſters of the Altar, to the end the People may be obedient to him who hath received Orders, becauſe they themſelves have given their conſent to the Ordination.</hi> It would be very tedious to reckon up all the Diſputes that were debated in that Congregation; every one would needs give him opinion, and every one thought it a piece of honour to alledge ſomething that was ſingular; eſpecially about the Queſtion, whether Epiſcopacy be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Order from Prieſthood, many words were
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:99003:248"/>profuſely ſpent. For all were not of the opinion of <hi>Thomas Daſſio.</hi> On the contrary there were a great many who maintained that it is onely a Dignity ſuperiour to that of a Prieſt, that gives a Juriſdiction, and not a different Order; and they backt their opinion by the Authority of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure.</hi> The School-men have made two Powers; one which they call <hi>Poteſtas Ordinis</hi> the Power of Orders; which, in their opinion, comprehends the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of pardoning ſins, offering the body of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> in Sacrifice, and of adminiſtring the other Sacraments, except Confirmation; and another, which is called, <hi>Poteſtas Juriſdictionis,</hi> the Power of Juriſdiction, which conſiſts in the Power of inflicting Cenſures, and the Execiſe of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction. It was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to define in which Power the Hierarchy conſiſted. Some placed it onely in the <hi>Power of Orders,</hi> and thereby they excluded from the Hierarchy Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Patriarchs, and the Pope himſelf, who are notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Principal Members therefore; for if the Power of Orders make up the eſſence of the Hierarchy, it is manifeſt that theſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not of the eſſence of the Hierarchy, becauſe they conſtitute not different Orders according to the Judgment of Divines. Others placed the Hierarchy in the <hi>Power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> but by that means the Pope, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Biſhops and Archbiſhops were the onely Members of the Hierarchy, and the Prieſts excluded. A third opinion ſtruck in, which eſtabliſhed the Hierarchy in the one and the other Power, both in that of Orders, and that of Juriſdiction; and this, as being the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:99003:249"/>moſt commodious was ſubmitted to by all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>They had no leſs trouble to agree upon that which makes the form of the Hierarchie; that is to ſay, what is the eſſential ground upon which the Character of the Sacrament of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of the Hierarchical dignity ſubſiſts, ſo that without this a man cannot be a capable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject neither of Prieſts Orders, nor of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Archiepiſcopal, or Papal dignity. Some ſaid it was Charity; but this opinion was clogg'd with a great difficulty, that a Prieſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Charity, muſt be excluded from the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, and loſe his Authority and Right of governing Chriſtian People, and opinion attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Wicliff.</hi> Others would have it to be Faith unformed or deſtitute of Charity. But to this it was objected, that it was not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that a Prelate might be without that Faith unformed, and be inwardly an Infidel; that in that caſe all the acts which he did, and all the Sacraments he adminiſtred would be of no effect, an opinion that might raiſe great Scruples, and put mens Conſciences into great perplexities. And therefore a third ſort, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this form in Baptiſm; but neither did that ſalve all difficulties, becauſe the intention of the Miniſter in Baptiſm is neceſſary, and that that intention is more hid than either Faith or Charity. So many difficulties appeared eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, that they could not tell what to ſix upon. The fourth Article which contained the queſtions, whether all Chriſtians be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators, whether a Prieſt may become a Laick, and whether the Miniſter of the Goſpel has no other office but to Preach, was not handled
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:99003:249"/>by way of examination; but onely by Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Congregation which had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the fifth and ſixth Articles met not with ſo great difficulties. The queſtion was to know whether the Holy Ghoſt be given in Ordination. All agreed upon it; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome ſaid, that the very Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt was conferred, and others maintained that it was onely by the gift of Grace. Some would have the Grace that is conferred is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be the gift of Juſtification. Others ſaid, that it was a peculiar gift, having a relation to the Office that was to be diſcharged. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed likewiſe that Orders did imprint a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; but ſome maintained that it was onely imprinted in the higher Orders, and others would have every one of the ſeven Orders to be effectual in ſtamping a Character. Some there were who made uſe of the diſtinction of <hi>Durandus,</hi> and ſaid that if by the Character were meant a power to doe a ſpiritual and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural action, that then that Character was onely imprinted in the Prieſthood: but if by the Character they meant a Deputation of a particular Office, that it that ſenſe all the Orders might have their Character. But that diſtinction was lookt upon to be dangerous, becauſe it favoured the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> for that is really their opinion, that the Character con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Deputation of a man to a certain charge, in ſuch manner that the man being no longer deputed to that Office, his Character is extinct. There was much more difficulty on the Subject of Epiſcopacy; for the queſtion was brought about again, to wit, whether it
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:99003:250"/>be a particular Order, and whether it ſtamps its Character: many were for the Affirmative, becauſe he hath two great ſpiritual actions to perform; that is, to Confirm and to give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that therefore the ſtandeth in need of a peculiar Gift and Character. Theſe Points were handled in ſo dry, knotty, and tedious a manner, that the Prelates who were preſent at the Diſputations were quite ſick of them; and that made them reſolve to be ſhort about theſe differences, and to define nothing but in general terms. The ſixth Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Unctions and the other Ceremonies of Ordination, to know whether they were eſſential to that Sacrament. That was not ſo eaſily agreed upon. All the Divines were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied indeed, to make a diſtinction betwixt thoſe which were of abſolute neceſſity, and thoſe which were leſs neceſſary: but when it came to be determined which were the leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Ceremonies, opinions varied extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Divine, Doctor of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, called <hi>Melchior Cornelio,</hi> ſhew'd that the Impoſition of hands was the onely Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that could be termed eſſential, becauſe the Apoſtles made uſe of it, and never gave Ordination without that Impoſition. He went a little farther, and proved that that Ceremony was not of abſolute neceſſity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt famous Doctors of the Canon Law, ſuch as <hi>Hoſtienſis, Johannes Andreas,</hi> and others do affirm, that the Pope can confer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by ſaying onely, <hi>Be thou a Prieſt. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> IV. Who is reckoned the Father of all the Canoniſts, and who hath made an <hi>Apparatus</hi> upon the Decretals, ſaith the ſame, that a Prieſt
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:99003:250"/>may be made Prieſt by a word of him that giveth Orders. From all which he concluded that it ought not to be defined that theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are neceſſary, becauſe the degree of the neceſſity cannot be limited, and that it ought to be enough to condemn thoſe who affirm that they are Superfluous or Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Conferences of the Divines, the Prelates were buſie about the matter of Reformation, and had many Conferences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves concerning it. Every day Aſſemblies were held upon that Subject at the Solicitation of the Ambaſſadours of Princes. The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were loud in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting their Grievances, and ſpoke of them to ſo many, that it was the whole town-talk in <hi>Trent.</hi> This gave the Legates á great deal of trouble, but on the other hand alſo,<note place="margin">The Preſidents make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Demands of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſend it to the Pope.</note> it did them ſome good; for they were aſhamed to ſee that they were the onely men who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Reformation which all <hi>Europe</hi> ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately deſired. Wherefore, at length, as if they had reſolved to make ſome ſteps towards a Reformation, they made a Collection of all the Propoſals of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and ſent it to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope might give them Orders what to doc about it. The Pope was vexed to ſee the Inſtructions which the King of <hi>France</hi> had ſent his Ambaſſadours; he deſigned to put an end to the Council at leaſt with the year, and by theſe inſtructions, he found that not onely they demanded of him a delay, but alſo that they intended ſtill to cut out work for the Council for a long time. He had many long Conferences upon
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:99003:251"/>that Subject with the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> reſiding at his Court. He told him that when he deſired the leaſt compliance from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council, immediately they cried out that he oppreſſed their Liberty; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not oblige the Prelates to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to which they had a deadly averſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were weary of the long ſtay that they had already made at <hi>Trent.</hi> At the ſame time he cunningly ſtruck at the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſaying that there was no neceſſity to wait for him, for handling Points of Doctrine which he did not in the leaſt ſcruple at as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Catholick, but that it was proper for him to be preſent at the Reformation, that he might come in for his ſhare as being a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pope, who enjoyed near a Million of <hi>Livres</hi> a year in Church Livings, and poſſeſt ſeveral Benefices, whilſt he himſelf being Pope enjoyed but one, wherewith he was content; that for his part he had not been wanting to reform himſelf and his Officers; that he would doe more ſtill, but that ſuch Reformations would ſink his Revenues, and that the ſmaller Rents he had, the leſs he would be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend the Church againſt Hereticks. He father ſaid, that he wiſhed with all his heart that they might come to particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe abuſes of which a Reformation was deſired, and that then experience would ſhew that moſt of them come from Princes; becauſe the abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which men kept ſo great a ſtir about, conſiſted chiefly in the promotions of undeſerving men to great Benefices, to which they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Kings, and in Diſpenſations that were
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:99003:251"/>extorted from him by the violent ſolicitations of Princes. That the other abuſes which were not in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in the ſeveral Provinces of the Church ſprung from the ſame ſource, to wit, the had uſe that Princes made of their Authority, in their Preſentations to great Benefices.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> find means of having the queſtion exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, and thereupon violent debates ariſe.</note>The fourth Congregation of Divines had in charge to examine the Superiority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over the Prieſt. At firſt they made a diſtinction betwixt the power of Conſecrating and Celebrating the Sacrifice, and the power of pardoning ſins. According to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> they ſaid, that the power of Conſecrating was alike in the Biſhop and Prieſt, becauſe in that properly conſiſts the power of Orders; but that the power of pardoning ſins was greater in the Biſhop than in the Prieſt, becauſe that power conſiſts not barely in that which is called the power of Orders, but is made up alſo of the power of Juriſdiction. They made ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions thereupon which were of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, nor occaſioned much debate; for they all unanimouſly agreed upon that Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the Biſhop over the Prieſt. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had pitcht upon this Article as the moſt proper to bring in the Queſtion which they intended ſhould be defined in ſpight of the Legates, to wit, whether Epiſcopacy be of Divine Right or not: that is to ſay, whether Biſhops hold their Authority immediately of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or onely of the Pope. They propoſed to themſelves great advantages from the deciſion of that Controverſie, becauſe by having it determined that the Biſhop is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:99003:252"/>Inſtitution, and that he derives his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and not from the Pope, they pretended to render their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter more conſiderable, and ſecure it from the attempts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if the Authority of Biſhops proceeds immediately from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it follows clearly that men can doe nothing to the prejudice of it. And if the Pope be not the Original of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is evident that he hath no power to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it, nor to exempt from under it thoſe that are ſubjected thereunto, as he dayly doth. The Legates at firſt, were not ſenſible of theſe Conſequences, and therefore they could not deviſe from whence ſprung that eagerneſs of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this Point, but they ſoon ſmelt it out, and vigorouſly withſtood it. So then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> according to their project put their Divines upon the breaking of the Ice, and beginning the Diſpute. <hi>Michael Oroncuſpe</hi> Divine to the Biſhop of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> was the firſt that propoſed the matter; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that in the deſign of condemning the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the queſtion moved properly upon this hinge, by what Right Biſhops were Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Prieſts; that as to the Superiority, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> could not deny it, but yet maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to be a mere Humane Conſtitution; that if then it were true that that Superiority was a Humane Eſtabliſhment, it would be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to make it Hereſie in the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that they aboliſhed an Order which was not appointed immediately by God; that for his own part, he lookt upon it as a moſt certain truth, that a Biſhop is Superiour to a Prieſt by Divine Right, but that he could proceed no
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:99003:252"/>farther, becauſe he was prohibited by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. <hi>John Fonſeca</hi> a Divine of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> obſerved not ſo ſtrict mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. He ſaid in the beginning of his diſcourſe, that he did not conceive why that queſtion was not allowed to be ſpoken to, and for what reaſon it could be prohibited. He laid open the importance of the matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Reaſon, by the Fathers and by the Scriptures, that Biſhops are the Succeſſours of the Apoſtles, as the Pope is of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> that both the one and the other have immediately received their Authority from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Supreme Courts and Inferiour Judicatures have been alike eſtabliſhed by the Prince, whence it is that Supreme Courts cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the Authority of Inferiour Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe the Authority of both flows from the Prince who hath ſet proper Limits to thoſe ſeveral Tribunals. Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme impatience liſtened to this diſcourſe, which was delivered with as great earneſtneſs. He turned ſeveral times about to his Collegues, and was ready to have interrupted the Divine; but he durſt not, becauſe he ſaw that all the Prelates heard him with extraordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. <hi>Anthony Graſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t,</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Monk, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced this truth with new Arguments, and carried it farther on. He affirmed that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were not obliged to give an account of their Adminiſtration but to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> alone. He urged the exhortation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus, that they ſhould feed the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers.</hi> If it be by the Holy Ghoſt, ſaid he, it is not by the Pope. He could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:99003:253"/>to laſh out againſt thoſe who in former Conferences had ſaid, that the Pope divides the Flock among the Biſhops, and ſaid it was to open a door to a kind of Schiſm which St. <hi>Paul</hi> found fault with in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they ſaid, <hi>I am of Peter,</hi> and <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> affirming that all Biſhops had right to ſay with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for me I am of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> He ſaid that the Pope was onely the Miniſter and Inſtrument of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore what is done in the Church ought not to be attributed to him, but to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> who is the Principal Efficient Cauſe. He perceived that his Diſcourſe had been a little too bold, and fearing that the Legates might enjoyn him ſilence, and bring him into trouble; he therefore made a kind of Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and ſaid that he had gone farther than he thought to have done, and that he had forgot that it had been prohibited to ſpeak to that Point. But the Legates ſaw into the Intrigue, and knew it to be a deſign laid by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and particularly the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada;</hi> but finding that the diſcourſes that were made had left a deep Impreſſion upon the minds of thoſe that were concerned; they thought it neceſſary to refute reaſons by reaſons, ſince matters were gone ſo far. Therefore they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the four Divines who were ſtill to ſpeak, to refute the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to prove that Biſhops hold all their Authority from the Pope, and not from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Epiſcopacy of Divine Right, is that of the Pope; who hath received Orders to place Biſhops in ſeveral Churches; and who hath alſo power to enlarge or reſtrain their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:99003:253"/>and to depoſe, ſuſpend, or tranſlate them to other places.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſputes of the Divines were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Legates had a mind to propoſe the matter of Reformation, but they knew not how to ſet about it. They durſt not offer at Trifles, as had been done in former Seſſions, and it was very difficult for them to propoſe important Points, there being none wherewith ſome body would not be diſpleaſed. The Reformation of the Biſhops and Clergy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly pleaſed the Ambaſſadours, but that diſpleaſed the Biſhops: that which pleaſed the Biſhops and Clergy, could not give content to the Ambaſſadours; for that tended to leſſen the Power that Princes had acquired over the Clergy, by the aboliſhing of Canonical Elections, and by the Right of Nomination to great Benefices. And, in fine, that which might pleaſe the Ambaſſadours and Biſhops, at the ſame time diſpleaſed the Pope, for that tended to the Diminution of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm'd by theſe Perplexities they wrote to the Pope, giving him notice, at the ſame time, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> preſſed hard, to have Epiſcopacy to be declared of Divine Right. They put the Pope alſo in mind that, this was the place where they had promiſed to ſtate again the Point of the Divine Right of Reſidence; to wit, when they treated of the Sacrament of Orders. They acquainted him that having ſounded the Prelates, they found threeſcore ſtedfaſt for the Divine Right of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, and that there was nothing to be got of them: that the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> had
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:99003:254"/>done all that lay in his Power to perſwade the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, but without any effect: that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> murmured that there ſhould be a deſign of referring that Article of Reſidence to his Holineſs, as the Point of the Cup had been, and ſaid if they intended to go on in that manner, it was very needleſs to call a Council at a great charge for deciding matters of ſmall importance, and refer the great affairs to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>This advice that came to the Pope from <hi>Trent,</hi> with the news which he received from other places gave him great diſturbance. For he had certain intelligence from ſeveral parts that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was coming to the Council with deſign to have the Election of the Popes ſo regulated,<note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> prepares to goe to the Council, and the Pope is allarmed at it.</note> that the Prelates beyond the <hi>Alpes</hi> might have a ſhare in that Dignity, and be choſen in their turn. He was allarmed at this news, wrote of it to all the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and laid before them what a prejudice it would be to ſuffer other Nations to ſhare in that advantage with them. He thought it alſo expedient for preventing the deſigns of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to renew the Publication of the Canons, which had been heretofore made againſt the Abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Election of Popes. He therefore publiſhed a Bull to that effect, bearing date the Ninth of <hi>October</hi> 1562. He received alſo vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious news from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> though that was the Court in Chriſtendom moſt at his Devotion; for he was informed that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> held Congregations about matters of Reformation; that he prepared new Propoſals, and deſigned the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> in quality of a
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:99003:254"/>new Ambaſſadour to carry his Propoſitions to the Council. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in the mean time being very well ſatisfied with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> becauſe he was wholly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Pope, was not willing that he ſhould either have a Collegue or a Succeſſour.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time the Abbot of <hi>Mante</hi> was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to acquaint the Pope in name of the King of <hi>France,</hi> that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with a good number of <hi>French</hi> Biſhops were ſetting out on their Journey to the Council. The news did not at all pleaſe him, becauſe he always dreaded the Union of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. However he muſt diſſemble and pay Complements with Complements. The Pope therefore profeſt that he expected great aſſiſtance from the Cardinal, who was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Eccleſiaſtick Perſon in <hi>Europe,</hi> and little inferiour to the Pope; but for all that, he ſaid he was obliged to haſten the Concluſion of the Council; becauſe it was ſo chargeable to him, that if it continued, he could not be able to furniſh the King the money that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him for the War. But to give a hint that he was reſolved to ſtand his ground againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and to maintain himſelf in his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority over the Council, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this, that for his own part he had no other Authority in the Council, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or reject its Decrees, ſeeing without his Confirmation they could have no force. By the ſame Envoy the Pope received very Civil Letters from the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain:</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get out of the Abbot of <hi>Mante</hi> what it was that the Cardinal had to propoſe
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:99003:255"/>to the Council, but the Abbot anſwered him onely in general terms.</p>
                  <p>The Pope had eſtabliſhed a Congregation of Cardinals for conſulting about and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the buſineſs of the laſt intelligence that he had received from <hi>Trent:</hi> and it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Congregation that the Point of Reſidence ought to be concluded before the arrival of the <hi>French;</hi> that the Legates ſhould uſe their utmoſt endeavours to get the matter referred to the Pope, that if there was no way to take the Prelates off from handling that Point, the next thing to be done was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree the neceſſity of Reſidence under Penalties and Proſpect of reward, but that they muſt have a ſpecial care not to declare it of Divine Right. The ſame courſe was agreed upon as to the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, that the Council muſt by no means be ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the Authority of Biſhops is derived immediately from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As to what concerned the Reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that his Holineſs muſt write to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates not to offer to meddle with it, and that for other parts of Reformation he ſhould leave it wholly to the Council: that the Legates ſhould pick out of the Propoſals of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, and the Reformations which the <hi>French</hi> had made at the Conference of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> what they judged moſt convenient, and let them paſs by Vote in the Council By this means they thought the Pope might perform the promiſe which he had often made to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to cauſe the Decrees of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> to be confirmed by the Council. But this Congregation of Cardinals found it a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:99003:255"/>harder matter what to determine as to the Concluſion of the Council. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> paſſionately deſired it; but they could not ſee how it could be ſo ſoon accompliſhed. They foreſaw that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who was ſhortly to be there would certainly find ways to appoſe it, by propoſing a great many new matters to be diſcuſſed: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the deſign he had of reforming the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes committed in the Election of Popes, he had many things to offer about the manner of Collation of Benefices, the Plurality of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, the Communion in both kinds, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Prieſts, and the Divine Service in the vulgar Tongue. Some were of opinion that the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> Legate in <hi>France</hi> ſhould be recalled, and the Legation given to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> hoping that that might work two good effects; firſt that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion would retain him in <hi>France,</hi> and then that the honour of it would ſatisfie that Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soul who was accuſed of having made parties to get himſelf choſen Patriarch in <hi>France.</hi> Others were for ſending a freſh ſupply of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to <hi>Trent,</hi> to counterbalance the intereſt and credit of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> So all things well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> thought it not fit to give the Legates preciſe Orders as to the Concluſion of the Council; but onely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to carry on things with all poſſible diligence, not to ſuffer the matter of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope to be touched; but rather to break up the Council and to return to <hi>Rome.</hi> Whilſt theſe reſolutions were taking at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Council named Prelates for framing the Chapters of Doctrine, and the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:99003:256"/>concerning the Sacrament of Orders: the chief of the Deputies were the Archbiſhop of <hi>Zara,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conimbre</hi> both <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> They made a Minute of the Decree, wherein they inſerted that the Biſhop is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the Prieſt by Divine Right: but the Legates oppoſed that, and would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Decree in that form, under pretext that no Deciſion ought to be inſerted, but ſuch as regarded the Articles that had been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that this was none of thoſe eight which had been ſubmitted to the Examination of the Divines. So that they not onely ſtruck out that Clauſe, but reſolved amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that if any <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelate in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations demanded that Article to be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> ſhould interrupt him, and aſſert that that was not a queſtion to be handled in the Council, becauſe there was no Controverſie about it betwixt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Hereticks. The firſt Congregation of Prelates after that of the Divines, was hold the thirteenth of <hi>October;</hi> there the Canons concerning Doctrine were read as they had been amended by the Legates. The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Biſhops who ſpoke firſt, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Decrees;<note place="margin">The Diſcourſe of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> to prove Epiſcopacy to be of Divine Right ſeconded by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and many others, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by the Pope's Party.</note> but when it came to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi>'s turn to ſpeak, he ſtuck at the ſeventh Article, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Superiority of the Biſhop over the Prieſt was mentioned, and demanded that it might be declared to be of Divine Right. And then he vigorouſly proved that Biſhops hold their Authority from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He brought a great many Arguments from Antiquity, to evince that Biſhops heretofore did not carry
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:99003:256"/>themſelves towards the Pope as to a Sovereign Maſter, that they called him their Brother and Collegue, and for inſtance alledged the Letters of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> He refuted ſmartly and in way of Raillery what the Divines of the Pope's Party ſaid, that either the Apoſtles were made by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or if they were made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it was a perſonal Privilege, and ought not to deſcend to Biſhops, as the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the Apoſtles. He maintained and explained the opinion of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> touching the <hi>Epiſcopat,</hi> that it is one, but that it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt all Biſhops, of which every one has an entire ſhare. He ſaid that the Pope was a Biſhop as he and all others were, becauſe they were all Brethren: that the Pope, indeed, was Chief of the College of Biſhops, but that notwithſtanding that Headſhip he was ſtill their Collegue, having received his Authority from one and the ſame Maſter. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Warmia</hi> according to the deſign that was laid, interrupted the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> telling him that they had no Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter with the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> To which the Archbiſhop replied, that it was not ſo; that they had Controverſie concerning that with the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> ſeeing the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg</hi> puts no difference betwixt a Biſhop and a Prieſt, but what was a Humane Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And ſo the Legates could not carry the point of impoſing ſilence on the Prelates; for the Biſhops inſiſted upon the ſame Subject, and the Archbiſhops of <hi>Zara,</hi> and <hi>Braganza</hi> ſtood ſtiffly up for the Propoſition of <hi>Granada,</hi> that it ſhould be inſerted in the ſeventh Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:99003:257"/>that the Superiority of the Biſhop over the Prieſt is of Divine Right: and maintained this <hi>Theſis</hi> by ſeveral Authorities, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Biſhops proceeds immediately from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Nine and fifty Prelates were of the ſame opinion, and the number, in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, had been much greater, had not a great many been abſent; ſome becauſe they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſick, and others becauſe they pretended to be ſo, that they might not be concerned in a Diſpute that would produce nothing but trouble to thoſe that ſhould ſpeak their mind freely, as it had happened in the Debate about Reſidence. The Biſhop of the five Churches joyned with the reſt in the opinion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Epiſcopacy. But above all, an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Prelate a <hi>Cordelier</hi> called <hi>George Ziſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chovid</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Seigna</hi> delivered his Judgment on that particular, in ſuch a manner aſtunn'd all the Pope's Party. For he ſaid, that it could never have entered his thoughts, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would have called in queſtion whether Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were of Divine Inſtitution or not, and it was the ſame thing as if the Council it ſelf ſhould queſtion the Divine Right of its own Authority. For if Biſhops, ſaid he, be not of Divine Right, the Council is onely an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Secular men, wherein <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> preſides not. No man gives that which he hath not, the whole is of the ſame nature with its parts; and ſo by conſequence it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that Councils derive their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God. He proceeded and ſaid farther, that the Biſhops who made up this Council had been very bold to pronounce <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, if they thought their Authority to be onely
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:99003:257"/>from a man. He proſecuted his Argument with ſo much vigour, and made the truth of it ſo perſpicuous, that the Aſſembly was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at his Diſcourſe. The Legates found now that no means were to be neglected on this occaſion; they did not at firſt perceive what was drove at; but they quickly came to underſtand that no leſs was thereby aimed at, than the wreſting the Keys out of the Pope's hands, and the giving them to all Biſhops in General: they ſaw that the deſign was to make Biſhops equal to the Pope, onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him the Dignity of Precedency. This put them to their ſhifts how to ward that blow. They ſet their uſual Engines to work; and ſolicited the Pope's Creatures to the end they might carry it by Faction and Parties. And at the ſame time to quiet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> they reſolved to grant them ſomewhat, by framing a Canon in theſe terms, <hi>that Biſhops have from God the Power of Orders,</hi> without mentioning the Power of Juriſdiction; and ſent Father <hi>Soto</hi> to ſolicite the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be ſatisfied with that; but there was nothing to be done with them. This method not ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Legates eſſayed to employ the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about other matters, to take their thoughts off from this; and, at length, endeavoured to have the Deciſion of that Point referred to the Pope. Nothing could be done in this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they could bring over a conſiderable number of Votes; and therefore to perſwade ſome, and to give a fair pretext of retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others who might be gained by tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they ſet on Father <hi>Lainez</hi> General of the Jeſuits. This Oratour appeared in the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:99003:258"/>liſts with a premeditated Speech, and if the truth were known, compoſed by the four Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits who were at the Council, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Caviglione.</hi>

He ſpoke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handſomely for the ſpace of two hours, with a great deal of Rhetorick and Vehemence. He laid down for his Point, that in the Pope alone all the Power of the Church reſides; and this he endeavoured to prove by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by the Fathers and by Reaſon. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> who ſaith that there is but one onely <hi>Epiſcopat,</hi> but he turned it into a quite different ſenſe to that which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> had given it. For he pretended that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Judgment of that Saint, there is but one Biſhop as one Epiſcopacy, and that the Pope is that one Biſhop who gives the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Power wherewith he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted to others under him, as he thinks good. He maintained that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> gave St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> alone the Commiſſion of ſeeding his ſheep, when he ſaid to him, <hi>feed my Lambs,</hi> and that St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave it to the reſt in theſe words which are to be read in the fifth Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>feed the Flock which is among you;</hi> that all Authority proceeds from the Pope; that though <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſent out the Apoſtles, yet in that he did the Office of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:99003:258"/>St. <hi>Peter;</hi> that Biſhops in all their Actions are no more but the Delegates and Subſtitutes of the Holy See, ſo that their Charge is but in Commiſſion, and if they be called Ordinaries, it is onely becauſe their Commiſſion is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and that they may have Succeſſours; that the Council derived no Authority from the Biſhops, but onely from the Pope, and that a Council cannot be reckoned General without the Authority of the Holy See: That fifty Prelates who decided important matters in the firſt Convocation of the Council under <hi>Paul</hi> III. could not, without the Pope, be called a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, nor in that Quality make Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſhould oblige the Conſcience; that when the Pope was preſent at a Council, he alone made the Decrees, and the Council in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in no more but their Approbation: wherefore on ſuch occaſions, it is onely ſaid <hi>ſacro approbante Concilio.</hi> He farther ſaid that in matters of great importance, the Pope needed not the Approbation of the Council, which appeared by the Depoſition of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. in the General Council of <hi>Lions:</hi> where <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. refuſed the Approbation of the Council, leſt it might have been thought neceſſary, and thought it enough to ſay <hi>ſacro preſente Concilio.</hi> In a word, that General broached the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of <hi>Italian</hi> Theology in ſavour of the Pope, beyond all imagination. This extravagant zealous diſcourſe produced very different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, for it raviſhed the Faction of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but diſguſted and offended moſt of the reſt to the higheſt Degree. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> proteſted that in the firſt Congregation when it ſhould come to his
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99003:259"/>turn to ſpeak, he would openly and boldly ſpeak againſt that Doctrine. He ſaid in all places, that it was invented by <hi>Thomas de Vio Cajetan</hi> that he might merit a Cardinals Cap for the good Service; that ever ſince he was born, it had been cenſured by the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> that the Government of the Church was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into Tyranny, and that the Spouſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was become a ſlave, and in a manner proſtituted to the luſt of one man. That he could no longer endure theſe Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Epiſcopal Authority, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon by every new Order of Monks that ſtart up in the World; that it had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great blow by the planting of thoſe two Seminaries of <hi>Clugny</hi> and the <hi>Ciſtertians;</hi> that ſince the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Orders appeared in the World, the Authority of Biſhops was almoſt wholly ſuppreſſed; and that in fine, to ruine the Church totally, that new Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> which was neither Secular nor Regular, was more Pragmatical than all the reſt in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Epiſcopal Authority. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes which the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> had in all Companies with extraordinary eagerneſs and zeal, rouzed up the drouzy, and blew the coals in thoſe who were already all in a flame; inſomuch that there was a murmuring, and univerſal diſcontent over the whole Council againſt the Harangue of the General of the Jeſuits; and therefore the Legate perceiving that it had wrought an effect quite contrary to what they expected, diſcharged him from publiſhing it, as he had intended. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he diſperſed ſeveral Copies of it, partly to get himſelf Reputation, and partly
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:99003:259"/>to ſoften ſome haſty words that he had let ſlip in ſpeaking. In the mean time the Legates gave not over their tamperings to make a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their Canvaſſing was ſo open and apparent, that <hi>Lanſac</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> a man of wit, and who was free enough in this diſcourſe, could not forbear to play upon them. One day at a great entertainment, there was a diſcourſe ſtarted about the form of Ancient Councils, wherein Princes by themſelves or by their Ambaſſadours, and the Preſidents of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil gave their ſuffrages, whereas neither one nor other gave their Votes in that of <hi>Trent.</hi> It is true, for Ambaſſadours, ſaid <hi>Lanſac,</hi> they have no Vote here, but for our Preſidents the Legates, they give <hi>vota auricularia,</hi> and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper their opinions ſoftly in the ear.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Legates met with ſome ſatisfaction, but of ſhort continuance, for a certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Doctor named <hi>Zanel,</hi> betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Party, preſented them with thirteen Articles of Reformation relating to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> which he was of opinion ought to be ſet on foot to ſtop the mouths of thoſe who appeared to be ſuch Zealous Reformers. Theſe Articles ſtruck at ſome Abuſes whereof the Reformation would have been very ſevere to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and mortified them extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But this Counterbatterie could not doe all the execution they deſired; becauſe theſe Articles of Reformation depended upon a great many others which related to the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> and the Legates were not of the mind to Sacrifice their own intereſt and that of their Maſter to a little revenge on their
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:99003:260"/>Enemies. After all they had enough to do to defend themſelves, they were not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of aſſaulting others, for the <hi>Spaniards, French,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> gave them continually the allarm. The Biſhop of the five Churches received Letters from the Emperour for the Legates, to procure of them that nothing but Reformation ſhould be handled, which was a freſh Perſecution. But they ſtood this brunt, and had no regard to the demand. They were ſomewhat indeed pleaſed that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Poland</hi> of whom they had no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and who was come to pay them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from afar, was arrived at the Council. The five and twentieth of <hi>October</hi> a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was held to receive that Ambaſſadour whoſe name was <hi>Valentine Herbut,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Premiſſa.</hi> But that was not enough to charm away the fear that the coming of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> put them in; he drew nearer and nearer dayly, and ſo did the Jealouſies and Apprehenſions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and of their Party at <hi>Trent.</hi> The Cardinal pleaſed himſelf in his Journey, to give it out that he was going to employ a good many Engines for leſſening the Grandure and Revenues of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> They therefore ſought out means to break his meaſures, and ſpoil his deſigns. Some Propoſed that the ſureſt way to put a ſtop to the <hi>French</hi> was, to take them on their weak ſide, and to demand the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their own abuſes. For they who are moſt eager in Reforming of others, are unwilling to be Reformed themſelves. The Pope who on his Part, thought on all the ways that might prevent the attempts that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:99003:260"/>were levelled againſt his Authority, gave the Legates Order to curb the boldneſs of the Prelates in a far other manner, than they had hitherto done. Nay, and there were ſome who adviſed the Pope to remove to <hi>Bologna,</hi> that ſo he might be near, and keep the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in awe. But the Legates found out a much better Expedient to get out of harms way, and that was to transfer, ſuſpend, or break up the Council; the difficulty conſiſted in the execution of this deſign; and becauſe that was a remedy which they could not make uſe of, they caſt about for another. They at firſt thought it moſt convenient to give time to the tumult to ſettle, which the Tempeſt of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Lainez</hi> diſcourſe had raiſed; and ſo they interrupted the Congregations. But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy augmented the Diſeaſe, and occaſioned complainings againſt the Legates, and many private Aſſemblies, where new meaſures were dayly taken againſt the intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> After ſeven days had been ſpent without any Congregation, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt all Patience; they went to the Legates who were met at Council, and demanded Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for making new Inſtances that Epiſcopacy might be declared to be of Divine Right. This they did in a ſtately grave manner according to the humour of that Nation; proteſting if that were refuſed them, they would appear no more in any Congregation or Seſſion. To Counterpoiſe this Party, the Legates ſolicited eighteen or twenty Prelates to demand with the ſame earneſtneſs that no Deciſion might paſs upon that matter. They looked upon this as an excellent Sally-port to get out at.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:99003:261"/>For, ſaid they, ſome would have it, others oppoſe it, what courſe can be taken to pleaſe both Parties? But this fetch of the Legates did not take; for that made the contrary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fortifie themſelves and to keep private Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in greater number, to find out means for ſupporting the Intereſt of their Cauſe. The Pope's Party did the like; ſo that the Council was broken and divided into a great many little Conventicles, which made ſo great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, that at length, the Legates feared ſome diſorder. The Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> was moſt concerned in the allarm, becauſe he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone expoſed to the ſhock of ſo many contradictions. He complained that he was not ſeconded by the Cardinals of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Seripando,</hi> and that they had ſtill ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inclination for the Party that oppoſed the Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents had likewiſe procured Letters from the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> wherein he preſſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to condeſcend, and not to offer at any thing that might be oppoſite to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Holy See. But they had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Inſtances of the Marqueſs; they made Proteſtations, indeed, that they had no intentions of propoſing any thing contrary to the Intereſt of his Holineſs; nevertheleſs they declared that they could not abandon the truth which they had eſpouſed; and that they doubted not to find eaſie means to Juſtifie their Conduct to the King: that they were ſent to act according to their Conſciences, and that they could doe nothing to the contrary. And, in effect, they ſent one of their number to <hi>Spain,</hi> to Juſtifie all their Proceedings to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:99003:261"/>At length the Congregations began again the third of <hi>November,</hi> and the Legates propoſed afreſh, the Articles of Doctrine concerning the Sacrament of Orders.<note place="margin">The matter of Reſidence is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain propoſed afreſh.</note> This was handled three days, that is, the ſame things that had been ſaid before were ſaid over again. In fine, the Legates after ſo long delay, being overcome by the inſtances that were made to them to keep their promiſe they had made of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point of Reſidence again under Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, reſolved now to propoſe it. They laboured to make a Deciſion that might give content to all, but found it a difficult task to caſt it in ſuch a mould as might ſatisfie both the Pope and the different Parties that were in the Council. For the Council was divided into three almoſt equal parts; the firſt were for referring the matter to the Pope; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond would have it decided in the Council; and the third that it ſhould be handled in the Council, but with the conſent of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There were four different opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of framing the Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reſidence. Some were for having the Neceſſity of Reſidence onely decreed under ſuch Penalties and Rewards as might keep Biſhops from violating that Law. Others were of opinion that the Decree ſhould be a bare Decree of Reference to the Pope. But ſome deſired that that Reference might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Prelates, and others that it ſhould be demanded by the Preſidents; ſo that this ſecond Party branched out into two. The third and laſt were of the Judgment, that the Pope without conſulting the Council ſhould anticipate its Deciſions, and emit a Bull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:99003:262"/>Reſidence; and then the Council would preſs the matter no more, it beng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done to their hands. But the Legates found Difficulties in all theſe opinions. It is true that the Biſhop of <hi>Mazara</hi> a Town in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> had by canvaſſing and caballing brought over ſeven Biſhops from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, and perhaps that was the thing that brought them to a determination. For, at length, they reſolved to ſtrike in with the firſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to frame the Decree, without deciding whether Reſidence were of Divine Right or not, but onely enjoyning it as neceſſary under Penalties and Rewards. The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed it to the Congregation in that form, and did it with all the Addreſs he could. He gave them to underſtand that all that could be required was onely a punctual performance of that which every one judged neceſſary, and that it was not convenient to deviate from that by needleſs Queſtions; that the matter was not great, of what Right Reſidence were, provided it were duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and added that it was the opinion of M. <hi>de Lanſac</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour. In the Decree, which was read, among other things it was enacted that Reſident Biſhops ſhould not be obliged to pay Tenths to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And this Clauſe was very gratefull to the Biſhops; but it ſtartled all the Ambaſſadours, and engaged them to oppoſe the Decree. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour took notice of two particular wrongs in the Conduct of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Mantua;</hi> the one was, that in the Decree the Catholick King was named before the moſt Chriſtian King; and the other, that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:99003:262"/>the Cardinal had abuſed his Confidence. For though he had in Diſcourſe let ſlip a word, and ſaid, that it ſignified not much whether Reſidence were of Divine Right, provided it were obſerved; what he ſpoke as a private Perſon in a familiar Converſation, ought not, in his opinion, to have been mentioned in Council as the opinion and advice of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour. The ſatisfaction which the Prelates received in that the Council had exempted them from Tenths, laſted not long: their eyes were immediately opened, and were let ſee that it was a ſnare laid for them, and a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wheadle to make them the better digeſt the refuſal of declaring the Divine Right of Reſidence, which was obſtinately made them. And indeed, they well perceived, that the Council intended to grant them a Privilege which they could not put them in poſſeſſion of, becauſe Princes would never give way to it: nay the <hi>Italians</hi> themſelves were made ſenſible that even in the Eccleſiaſtick State, matters would goe as they had gone before, and that they would be ſtill made to pay, by virtue of a fair, <hi>non obſtantibus, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right.</note>In the Congregation the day after, they came to ſpeak again of the Sacrament of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Biſhop of <hi>Segovia</hi> revived the queſtion of the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy. This Biſhop had been a Member of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil held under <hi>Julius</hi> III. wherein Epiſcopacy was ſaid to have been defined to be of Divine Right. The Legates and Penſioners of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> maintained that no ſuch thing had been done in that Council. And the Biſhop of <hi>Segovia</hi> who had a very freſh Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:99003:263"/>averred that it had, and mentioned the hour and day when it was ſo decided. The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſeemed to be very incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and ordered the Acts of Council to be brought out. Which being done, theſe words were found in the third Chapter of Doctrine concerning the Sacrament of Orders. <hi>Beſides that, the holy Council teacheth, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have been inſtituted by Divine Right, ſeeing it is evident in the Goſpel, that our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>himſelf called the Apoſtles, and promoted them to the Degree of Apoſtleſhip; and in their places the Biſhops have ſucceeded. It ought not then to enter into the thoughts of any one, that that ſo eminent and neceſſary a Degree hath been brought into the Church by Humane Inſtitution. And the eighth Canon ſaid, that whoſoever ſhall ſay that Biſhops are not inſtituted by Divine Right,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let him be</hi> Anathema. This was poſitive and downright: and therefore the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> was ſuſpected to have cauſed this Piece to have been produced, purpoſely to favour an opinion which he held, and durſt not openly declare and own. For all that, the Pope's Party would not yield; but they durſt not ſay that the Council had erred, for the Decree had been framed by the ſame men that had made the reſt, which paſt for Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith; and for want of the Formality of Publication, it was no leſs the Act of a Council to which Infallibility was aſcribed. They therefore ſtood their ground, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that theſe words ought to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Power of <hi>Orders,</hi> and not of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction;</hi> ſo that the Congregation was ſpent in Janglings about the Senſe of the Decree.</p>

                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:99003:263"/>At length the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having been long expected, entered <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Pope could not but cauſe the Seſſion to be put off,<note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Pope ſends to ſound him.</note> that the Cardinal might be preſent at it.

The Cardinal was received at <hi>Trent</hi> with great Ceremony;<note place="margin">He arrives at <hi>Trent.</hi>
                     </note> he made his Entry on Horſeback betwixt the Cardinals of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Seripando,</hi> who were the two chief Legates. The ſame day he viſited the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and next day had Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Preſidents. This Audience paſt in Civilities, and mutual Proteſtations of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; onely the Cardinal ſaid, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil muſt not be taken up about nice and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs queſtions; that the Debates which had divided it about the queſtions of the Divine Right of Reſidence and Epiſcopacy had done great injury to its reputation, that it ought to be their whole buſineſs to reclaim to the Church the Members who were ſeparated from her; that for his own part he did not think it an impoſſible matter, and that many of them, and amongſt the reſt the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> had a deſign to come to the Council; and that it was neceſſary for bringing them nearer to ſet about a good Reformation, without which, whereas the King his Sovereign at preſent had onely to doe with <hi>Huguenots,</hi> he would very ſuddenly find work enough with Catholicks. To conclude, he told them that he had brought new Inſtructions to the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France,</hi> that he deſired to ſpeak in name of the King
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:99003:264"/>in the next Congregation, and that afterward he ſhould doe no more but give his opinion freely, as an Archbiſhop. They made him anſwer in General terms, commending his Piety and Devotion towards the Holy See, and excuſed themſelves that the Council had ſpent ſo much time about matters of ſo ſmall importance, laying the blame on the Licence that the Prelates took to themſelves in giving their opinions. They added that they hoped for the future things would goe better, and that his preſence would contribute much to it. After ſeveral other matters had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, it was concluded that on <hi>Munday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Cardinal ſhould appear in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Congregation, to declare the reaſons of his coming, and preſent the King's Letters. Though they had ſtood onely upon General terms, yet the Party of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> conceived ſome Umbrage at the Cardinal's Speech, becauſe all his Actions were ſuſpected. Some Diſcourſes that the <hi>French</hi> Abbots had had at <hi>Milan</hi> encreaſed the ſuſpicions; for they had been heard to ſay, that they were going to the Council with deſign to joyn with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they were reſolved to have <hi>Annates,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Plurality of Benefices, and other Abuſes aboliſhed; threatning that if they were refuſed what they had to demand, they would make but little noiſe, but return and order their own buſineſs at home. Beſides that, it was known that the Cardinal entertained a very ſtrict Correſpondence with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, of whom the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was not very ſure, and likewiſe with <hi>Maximilian</hi> King
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:99003:264"/>of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was more ſuſpected by them than his Father. The Pope's Party reliſhed very ill what the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had told them of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> coming to the Council, becauſe of the Conference that he had heretofore had with that Duke, and they feared that ſome agreement might have been made betwixt the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Emperour and the <hi>Germans,</hi> to force the Council to doe more than the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was willing they ſhould. They were even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might enter into that League, becauſe after the Departure of the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> whom he ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to <hi>Trent,</hi> he had diſpatched after him <hi>Martin Gazdellun</hi> heretofore Secretary to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fith, with inſtructions which he was not willing to truſt to Letters. They immediately acquainted the Pope with all that had paſt, and gave their obſervations accordingly. But that the <hi>French</hi> might take no Umbrage at it, they made the Courier ſet out privately, and wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> that when he came back, he ſhould have orders to ſteal into <hi>Trent</hi> without any noiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could not come to <hi>Mundays</hi> Congregation, becauſe of a ſit of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that obliged him for ſome days to keep his Chamber. The Congregation, notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was held, but nothing was done in it, onely a General Review made of all the Members of the Council, who upon occaſion of the <hi>French</hi> who were juſt come, had their ſeveral places aſſigned them anew. In this Review they found the number of the Prelates to amount to two hundred and eighteen. The Council
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:99003:265"/>was extremely well ſatisfied to ſee they were ſo numerous; and yet that number comes far ſhort of moſt part of the Ancient Councils. None of the <hi>French</hi> ſpoke, neither in this nor in the following Congregation, becauſe they waited for the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> looked upon theſe new-comers, as a powerfull reinforcement come to the aſſiſtance of their Enemies: and therefore they doubled their vigilance, and thought it beſt to fortifie themſelves by new Councils. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto</hi> was one of the leading men of that Party, and one of the moſt zealous ſticklers for the Grandure of the Pope. He had a mind to aſſemble all thoſe who were linked with him in the ſame Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, but ſo as it might not appear to be done with intention to treat of buſineſs: and for that purpoſe on the nineteenth of <hi>November,</hi> he made a great Entertainment for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates who were called the well affected. He that invited them told them that for the ſake and ſervice of the Holy See they ſhould not fail to come. It was not doubted but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was laid, for making a League againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and they had certain notice given them, that there had been long Conferences about the Subject, in that Aſſembly. An acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that M. <hi>de l'Iſle</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour had done at <hi>Rome,</hi> encreaſed theſe Umbrages againſt the <hi>French;</hi> for during an indiſpoſition which by ſome accident had happened to the Pope, that had almoſt coſt him his life, he began to tamper and carry on a kind of Negotiation, that if the Pope ſhould chance to die, the next Pope might be choſen at <hi>Trent</hi>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:99003:265"/>by Nations, and that the See might remain Vacant, untill the Reformation ſhould be completed, that ſo the Council might be free, and that the Pope Elect might accept of that Reformation, according as he ſhould find it ſetled. This vexed the Pope to purpoſe; for beſides that theſe deſigns did not at all pleaſe him, men do not like that way of counting before the Hoſt, and framing of Deſigns in proſpect of their death. All theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether allarmed him mightily, ſo that he held ſeveral Congregations of Cardinals, wherein he deſired them to find out ſome ſure means to ſecure him from the Enterpriſes of the Council, which, as he ſaid, he conſidered as his greateſt Enemy. He was certainly very faithfully ſerved by his Penſioners; and yet it was not altogether to his mind; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that all the Biſhops whom he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained were againſt him, and that he ſed an Army of Enemies at <hi>Trent.</hi> Notwithſtanding he continued ſtill to multiply theſe Enemies; for he ſent away all the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> even to the Biſhop of <hi>Aoſta</hi> Ambaſſadour there from the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But he diſcharged the Archbiſhop of <hi>Torre</hi> from going thither, becauſe in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> III. he had maintained the Divine Right of Reſidence with ſome Zeal and Fervour. He made the ſame prohibition to the Biſhop of <hi>Ceſana,</hi> becauſe he was the intimate friend of the Cardinal of <hi>Naples,</hi> whoſe two Uncles the <hi>Carraffa</hi>'s the Pope had put to death by the hand of the common Executioner, beſides the Perſecutions wherewith he had afflicted himſelf, and ſo had reaſon to conſider him as
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:99003:266"/>an Enemy. About the ſame time he diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into <hi>France, Sebaſtiano Gualtero</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> a thorough pac'd Zealot for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The pretext of this Embaſſie was, the carrying of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns to the King, being part of an hundred thouſand which the Pope had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him for the War againſt the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> but the true reaſon was, that he might be a Spie over the Actions of the Council of <hi>France.</hi>

But at length they ſuffered themſelves to be over perſwaded by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and permitted <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> to ſpeak. The King's Letters to the Council were then read, which contained one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayers, and general Exhortations to ſet about a Reformation of the Church. The Letters being read; the Cardinal ſpoke, and began with a long and pathetick deſcription of the miſeries which the Wars about Religion cauſed in <hi>France,</hi> and prayed the Council to remedy them. He inſiſted upon what he had already ſaid to the Legates, that they ſhould avoid all unneceſſary queſtions; and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two things in the name of the King of <hi>France;</hi> firſt that they might have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:99003:266"/>to thoſe who were ſeparated from the Church, in granting them all that might be allowed without doing prejudice to the Faith; and that they would conſider them as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as far as might be. Next he demanded in name of the King, a Reformation in the Church, whereof he laid open the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Corruptions, and there took an occaſion to make an ingenious Application to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Hiſtory of <hi>Jonas.</hi> We, we are the cauſe of the Storm, ſaid he, throw us into the Sea, and the Tempeſt will ceaſe. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Mantua</hi> made a civil anſwer to that Harangue, proteſting that the Council had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been extremely concerned for the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>France,</hi> and would doe all that was poſſible to clear the truth, confirm the true Service of God, and rectifie the manners and the diſorders in Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadour <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> had leave to ſpeak next, and ſpoke very ſmartly. He told them that his Maſter demanded that the Church might be reſtored to its Ancient Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, and that the good and holy Laws which the Devil had ſtole away and hid, might be brought back from Bondage into the City of God. He made uſe of an Alluſion that prickt to the quick the Adorers of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> If you ask me, ſaid he, why <hi>France</hi> is not in peace, and whence proceed thoſe horrible diviſions that rend it in pieces. I ſhall anſwer as <hi>Jehu</hi> did to <hi>Joram</hi> when he asked, <hi>is it peace,</hi> Jehu? <hi>What peace ſo long as,</hi> &amp;c. anſwered he; here he ſtopt, ſaying ye know the reſt.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:99003:267"/>the reſt the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> ought to be moſt ſuſpected, becauſe he ſided with the Queen for favouring the Hereticks.

                  <p>The Seſſion was to have been held the ſix and twentieth of <hi>November.</hi> But there was nothing in readineſs, and it was to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the Legates to complain of the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Prelates in giving their opinions, the Seſſion muſt of neceſſity be deferred <hi>ſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> becauſe they could not tell when matters would be ready. During all this, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> abated nothing of their Zeal, for having Epiſcopacy to be declared of Divine Right. The Senator <hi>Molinez</hi> being ſent by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi> from <hi>Milan</hi> came to <hi>Trent,</hi> to deal with the <hi>Spamards</hi> that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend; but that was to no purpoſe.

However they were not ſo eager up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to have the Point deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Council. On the contrary they would have been very well ſatisfied that the Council ſhould have waved thoſe curious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, as they called them, and applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the matter of Reformation, which in their opinion was of far greater Conſequence, and that they alſo moved in the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and many times warmly urged it.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:99003:268"/>In the Congregation of the twenty ſixth of <hi>November</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Nimes</hi> moved that they ſhould not concern themſelves ſo much about a Controverſie of ſo little Importance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was no more but a ſtrife of words, but that ſome regard ought to be had for other Prelates, and for time which was thereby ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſpent. <hi>Don Diego Covarruvias</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rodrigo</hi> replied, that they had been obliged to give their opinions upon that Subject, ſince the matter had been propoſed by the Legates. The Cardinals <hi>Seripando</hi> and <hi>Simoneta</hi> roſe up, and denied that the Legates had made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and becauſe they ſound themſelves backt by the <hi>French,</hi> they ſpoke bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Liberty that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took to themſelves.

To prove this he alledged the inſtance of the four Suffragans of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltzburg,</hi> who took no confirmation from the Pope, and were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs owned to be lawfull Biſhops. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Simoneta</hi> interrupting him ſolved the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty thus; that if the Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> and other Primats confirmed Biſhops, they did it by Authority from the Pope. But <hi>Tomaſo Caſſello</hi> Biſhop <hi>della Cava</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> a ſlave to the Pope, and one whom the Legates employed to raiſe ſtirs, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not there: for ſtarting up, he cryed out that the Biſhop of <hi>Guadix</hi> ought to be turned out as a Schiſmatick. Two or three Biſhops of the ſame Faction ſeconded him; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followed a fearfull noiſe of Tongues, Hands, and Feet in the Aſſembly, ſome for the Biſhop who was accuſed of Schiſm, and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:99003:269"/>ſome againſt him. This exceedingly diſpleaſed the Biſhops beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who thereby ſaw what they were to expect, when they ſhould offer to ſpeak with any freedom. When the noiſe was over, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could not forbear to ſay, that it was an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Procedure; that the Biſhop of <hi>Guadix</hi> had not ſpoken amiſs, and if he had been a <hi>French</hi> Prelate, that he himſelf would have appeal'd to a freer Council: that if ſuch things were ſuffered, the <hi>French</hi> would depart and hold a National Synod in <hi>France.</hi> In effect, this poor Biſhop had ſo much reaſon in what he ſaid, that the Council was obliged to alter the Canon according to his advice, and inſtead of <hi>Biſhops called,</hi> they ſaid, that <hi>Biſhops promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by the Pope are lawfull.</p>
                  <p>The Congregation met again next day, and appointed the Seſſion to be held the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the ſame Month of <hi>December.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſeverely Cenſured the Tumult which happened the day before: the Biſhop <hi>della Cava</hi> would not ſubmit, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified himſelf, affirming that he had reaſon to ſay what he ſaid, his Carriage was lookt upon to be inſolent and proud; but it was born with, becauſe he was of the darling Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

He confirmed his opinion by ſtrong Arguments, and then proved it to be falſe that the power of the Church was put into the hands of a ſingle Perſon; he went on
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:99003:269"/>and ſaid, that the Popes power did not extend to the annulling of Canons, and aboliſhing of Laws; and thereupon began to quote the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons alledged dy <hi>Gratian,</hi> wherein the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Popes acknowledged themſelves ſubject to the Decrees of the Fathers, and of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours.

He proved by divers paſſages of the Ancients, which made them admire his Memory, that it is of Divine Right. But on the other hand he alledged ſeveral inſtances of Biſhops who had owned, that they held all their Authority from the Holy See; ſo that his diſcourſe was ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and ſo full of uncertainty and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity, that it was manifeſt enough he had no mind to declare his poſitive opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Point.

So that the firſt part of their diſcourſe diſpleaſed the Legates, and Pope's Penſioners, and the latter part, the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The truth is, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> drove at the ſame end, to wit, the maintaining the Authority of Biſhops againſt the ambitious enterpriſes, and covetous ſelf-intereſſed Practices of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But they took different ways to doe this, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different humours of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who are cloſe and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, were for ſtriking at the root of the Pope's Authority by hidden Mines, and were perſwaded that if it were one declared that Epiſcopacy and Reſidence are of Divine Right, the Epiſcopal Order would retrieve its Credit with the People, and ſo they might with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

They judged it therefore neceſſary, without farther Myſtery, to have it defined, that a Council is Superiour to the Pope, or at leaſt, to have it enacted, that the Pope may not diſpenſe with, nor derogate from the Canons. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> wiſhed with all their hearts that theſe Deciſions could have been obtained from the Council; but they thought it impoſſible, nor could they find a fair occaſion to ſtate the Queſtion, nor any Pretext to quarrel with the Pope's Authority, ſince they admit of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> whereas the <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which hath placed a Council above the Pope, and reject that of <hi>Florence.</hi>

The death of this Prince was like to have changed the Countenance of the Council; for the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was tempted to return to <hi>France,</hi> becauſe there was like to be a great alteration of Aſſairs in that Kingdom, and he could have been willing to have been there, to take a ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The following Congregation was taken up in Ceremonies of Thankſgiving for the Election of <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was choſen King of the <hi>Romans.</hi> That was the thing the Emperour had been driving at for a long time; and ſo ſoon as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, he entered into Conference with the Proteſtant Princes, to perſwade them to ſubmit to the Council. They met about it, and having conſulted together in common, they preſented to the Emperour the anſwer which they promiſed ſome twenty months before in the Aſſembly of <hi>Naumburg.</hi> In that anſwer they declared, that from all that was done in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> they appealed to a free Council, and propoſed ten Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they knew well enough would not be granted them, upon which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come to the Council, and ſubmit to it. For inſtance they demanded that it might not be called by the Pope, that he ſhould not preſide in it, that he ſhould be ſubject to it, that all things ſhould be decided in it by the word of God alone, that the Divines of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion might have a Deciſive
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:99003:272"/>Vote in it; that matters ſhould not always be carried by Plurality of Votes, but by thoſe which were moſt conſonant to truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Emperour received the Writing, and in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Terms promiſed to endeavour the ſetling of Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Decree of Reſidence is completed, and it is not deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whether it he of Divine Right or not.</note>After ſo much time and ſo many words ſpent about the Article of the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, nothing was ye concluded, becauſe the Legates expected the Deciſion from <hi>Rome.</hi> Whilſt this was expecting they publiſhed the Chapter of Reſidence, wherein without deciding whether it be of Divine Right or not, it was commanded under Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties and Reward. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who was Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> and who in all appearance had no deſign to reſide there, gave his opinion about the neceſſity of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in his ordinary manner, overturning in one period what he had ſet up in another. At the ſame time the Legates communicated to the Ambaſſadours of Princes, ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Reformation which related to ſeveral Abuſes about the Sacrament of Orders, againſt the next Seſſion. But the Ambaſſadours, and particularly theſe of the Emperour, and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> valued them but very little, becauſe they ſound none of the Heads which they had propoſed amongſt them.<note place="margin">Reaſons that ſhew it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Demands which all made for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould have any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</note> They complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they were ſtill amuſed with Trifles, and that the more weighty matters were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. It was, really, a rare and edifying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion to conſider with what fervour and zeal the Ambaſſadours and moſt of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates demanded Reformation: It may be ſaid that the Pope, Princes and Biſhops all of them
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:99003:272"/>demanded it, and agreed to the Point in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But when it came to particulars, they could not jump together in any one thing, becauſe of the prodigious diverſity of intereſts, and becauſe every one was for reforming his Neighbour, but would not be medled with himſelf. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> conſented cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Reformation of the Biſhops and Princes, provided it might be let alone. The Biſhops deſired the Reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of Princes, to get themſelves out of the reach of the attempts of the Secular Power and of the Pope, but they could not endure that their own Coppy-hold ſhould be touched, either as to their Authority, or the Diminution of their Revenues. Princes and Kings demanded the Reformation of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy both in the Head and Members, but they would in no terms let goe the means they had in their hands of oppreſſing the Church, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Canonical Elections, and conferring Benefices upon whom they thought ſit. The People who, alone, as being diſintereſſed, could labour moſt effectually in that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, had neither Vote nor Credit in the Council. And therefore all that great deſign of Reformation muſt needs vaniſh in ſmoke.</p>
                  <p>Since the Legates had made way for falling again upon the Point of Reſidence, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Chapter to be read, which they had framed for decreeing it, the Prelates began to ſpeak again upon the ſame Subject. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> aſſembled all the <hi>French</hi> at his houſe, and would hear them ſpeak to that Point, where they all with one conſent concluded Reſidence to be of Divine Right.
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:99003:273"/>In one of the ſubſequent Congregations, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto Duimio</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Veglia,</hi> and Iſland of <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> delivered his opinion with much force, he demonſtrated the ſame thing by a great many Reaſons and Arguments; which none before him had done, but barely declared their Judgment upon the Point, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the probation of it. He laid great ſtreſs upon the ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>that the good ſhepherd goes before his ſheep, and the ſheep follow him: for they know his Voice.</hi> He could not throughly handle nor dive to the bottom of that Subject, without hinting at many things contrary to the Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Pope's Authority: and Cardinal <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneta</hi> durſt not interrupt him, becauſe of the Scuffle that ſome days before happened upon occaſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Guadix,</hi> who had been interrupted; but he took him up privately and rebuked him ſharply, for having ſpoken againſt the Pope. The Biſhop made the beſt excuſe he could, and ſome days after deſired leave to be gone upon Pretext of indiſpoſition, which was very willingly granted him.</p>
                  <p>About that time, the Controverſie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reſidence changed Countenance, there was now no bringing of Arguments and Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies to prove it to be of Divine Right, and they who judged it to be of Humane Right took no more pains to find out reaſons to confirm their Sentiment. They thought it enough to overcome the contrary Party, by the Conſequences of their Doctrine; for, ſaid they, that opinion tends directly to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Authority of the Pope: becauſe, by aſſerting the Divine Right of Reſidence,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:99003:273"/>it takes from him the Power of transferring, diminiſhing, dividing, uniting and changing Epiſcopal Sees; and indeed that was the deſign of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But they diſſembled it, and wanted not reaſons to prove that the Divine Right of Reſidence would advance the Papal Dignity, and render it more conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when Biſhops did reſide; the Revenue towards the Clergy would encreaſe, and by conſequence the Authority of the Pope, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chief of Biſhops. And ſo from that time forward the Greatneſs of the Pope was the onely hinge upon which moved that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about Reſidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Minute of a Decree is made at <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the Authority of the Pope and Biſhops, which was rejected by the Biſhops in Council.</note>The Pope was ſo much afflicted for the death of his Nephew <hi>Frederico Borromeo,</hi> that he fell dangerouſly ſick conſidering his great age. And yet the troubles he received from the Council vexed him more than the death of his Kinſman. He held frequent Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cardinals for determining thoſe two Controverſies which made ſo much noiſe, about the Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence As to that of Inſtitution, he gave his anſwer at laſt, that it was an erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Epiſcopacy <hi>as to the Power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> was of Divine Right, and inſtituted by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> unleſs it were in this Senſe, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> does all that the Pope doth, and concluded that theſe words <hi>of Divine Right</hi> ought to be wholly left out, or that the Decree muſt be made in this form, <hi>That</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath inſtituted Biſhops to be made by the Pope with ſuch Authority as he ſhould think fit to give them for the good of the Church, it being ſtill in his Power to enlarge or reſtrain it.</hi>
                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:99003:274"/>As to the Point of Reſidence he gave Orders that it ſhould not be declared of Divine Right, becauſe he would retain to himſelf the Power of diſpenſing with it; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they did, they ſhould have a care that nothing were enacted contrary to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As to the Prorogation of the Seſſion, he wrote in General Terms, that it ſhould not be put off above a Fortnight, nor yet held unleſs all matters were in a readineſs. The Legates thought that the Decree about the Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, and of the Pope's Power over Biſhops, in the form that it was ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> would never be admitted in the Council; and therefore they found themſelves obliged to write a ſecond time, and ſend the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the matter of Cup was referred to the Pope, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having no more to demand of the Council as to that Point, ſent a ſolemn Embaſſy to <hi>Rome</hi> for obtaining of it. This Embaſſy went by <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Ambaſſadours had Conferences with the Legates and Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> That allarmed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who always oppoſed the Reſtitution of the Cup. At the ſame time the news of the Battel of <hi>Dreux</hi> came to <hi>Trent,</hi> which was fought the ſeventeenth of <hi>December.</hi> The Catholicks gave out that they had obtained the Victory, though they loſt in it almoſt double the number that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had loſt; for they loſt five thouſand men, and the Proteſtants but three. But they alledged that they continued Maſters of the Field. The two Generals were taken Priſoners, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> on the ſide of the Proteſtants, and the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:99003:274"/>Conſtable on the Catholicks ſide. This was a fatal Year for the terrible Diviſions that rent <hi>France</hi> in pieces: no leſs that fourteen Armies at one time on foot, which on both ſides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fearfull diſorders. Admiral <hi>Coligny</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Battel, notwithſtanding the taking of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> kept his Army together, and made even ſome progreſs. Nevertheleſs, there was a Thankſgiving at <hi>Trent</hi> for the Victory, as if it had been real, when, indeed, it was but imaginary. They were perſwaded at <hi>Rome</hi> that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> were totally routed, and that ſo there was no more need of a Council, wherefore ſome were of opinion that it ſhould either be diſſolved or ſuſpended. But the Pope had better news than the reſt, and ſaw very well, that it was not yet time to diſſolve the Council. He thought he did enough if he could retain the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that he had got over it. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's deſign of coming to <hi>Inſpruck</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Trent,</hi> filled him with new Jealouſies. He made no doubt, but that he had ſecret intelligences with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and he could not ſee into the Bottome of it. So much he knew in General, that theſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences tended to the leſſening of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Reformation of the Abuſes of his Court. And therefore to prevent Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from thoſe hands through which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had not mind to paſs, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Brief dated the twenty ſeventh of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> whereby he reformed ſome Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Rota;</hi> and made alſo ſome other ſlight Reformations of his Court. This, in the main, came to nothing at all, but however it was uſefull to his Legates and Penſioners at
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:99003:275"/>
                     <hi>Trent;</hi> for they made anſwer to thoſe who demanded the Reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſeeing the Pope made it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reform himſelf, the Council might very well ſpare themſelves the trouble. The year one thouſand five hundred ſixty and two was concluded with a Congregation held the thirtieth of <hi>December,</hi> wherein it was reſolved to put off the Seſſion for a Fortnight.</p>

Moſt part of them regarded the Reformation of the Clergy, and the abuſes in Ordination, and in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring undeſerving men both as to manners and learning. Some of them alſo related to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and tended to the diminution of its Revenues. The fourteenth of theſe Articles demanded a prohibition of the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Benefices, the ſixteenth, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be adminiſtred <hi>gratis.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteeth they demanded Divine Service in the Vulgar Tongue; that is to ſay, that the chief Prayers ſhould be ſaid in <hi>French</hi> as well as in <hi>Latin.</hi> The eighteenth propoſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds, and required the revival of the Decree of <hi>Gelaſus.</hi> The twenty ſixth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Reſtitution of the Juriſdiction of Biſhops in all their Dioceſes over all that lived within them, not excepting Monaſteries; unleſs the Chiefs of Orders, and the Monaſteries where the Generals of Orders did reſide. The nine and twentieth deſired Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the abuſe which the People made of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:99003:275"/>Images, the abuſe of Pilgrimages, Fraternities, Relicks, and Indulgences. The thirtieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſtitution of the cuſtome of publick Pennance, as it had been in the primitive Church. The Legates and Pope's Party diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked theſe demands, and the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were preſented; for that was with the uſual Threat, that if they had not ſatisfaction in admitting their Propoſals, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves by a National Council. The Legates ſent theſe Articles to the Pope, being very ſure that he could not read them but with extraordinary trouble, eſpecially ſeeing one of the Propoſitions demanded the aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Annates,</hi> and of all the other means, which are uſed at <hi>Rome</hi> for hooking in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Provinces. They commiſſioned the Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo</hi> to carry theſe Memoires to the Pope; and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> loaded him with Complements for his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deſiring him that he would beſeech his Holineſs not to take it ill that the King, and they by Orders from him, did demand things which they judged neceſſary for the wellfare of <hi>France,</hi> and at the ſame time and by the ſame hand offered the Pope his Mediation for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the differences about the Inſtitution of Biſhops and Reſidence. Theſe Memoires of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were given to the Legates, without the hearty condeſcenſion of the Prelates of that Nation. For there were ſome Articles amongſt them, that tended to the Diminution both of the Authority and Revenues of the Biſhops, which went againſt the Hair. But they conſented that they might be preſented to the Council, in hopes that the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:99003:276"/>
                     <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops who are Great Lords, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Grandure would have oppoſed them. When they ſaw that the Memoires were ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> they perceived that it would fall to the Pope's ſhare, to cut and carve in them, as he had done in all the reſt, and they were afraid that he might compound with the King of <hi>France</hi> to their Coſt; in ſacrificing to him the intereſt of the Biſhops, to make him ſpare the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> as it had been done betwixt <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt and <hi>Leo</hi> X. when they made the <hi>Concordat.</hi> And therefore they began to make ſecret Cabals to get the Articles that concerned them ſtruck out of the Memoires. But <hi>Lanſac</hi> perceiving it, called them together, and rebuked them ſeverely for daring to oppoſe the Will of the King.</p>
                  <p>There were now two Biſhops in Deputation at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> and <hi>Viterbo.</hi> The firſt was employed to make freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances about the Subject of the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops, and their Reſidence, that the Pope might put the Decree into another form than that which he had formerly ſent. He arrived the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> having made his Journey in ſeven days. He gave the Pope an account of all that paſt in the Council, and of the different diſpoſitions of the Members of it. The Pope immediately held a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Cardinals about the Point of the Inſtitution of Biſhops, which was moſt urgent. And it was there reſolved that the Deciſion ſhould be ſent to the Legates, in this form. <hi>That Biſhops hold the chief rank in the Church dependant on the Biſhop of</hi> Rome; <hi>by whom they
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:99003:276"/>are admitted and received</hi> in partem ſolicitudinis. It was upon the main the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but the form a little ſofter: and the Pope for a recompence of the qualification which he had ſuffered to be made in the Canon of the Inſtitution of Biſhops, would have the Canon that related to his own Authority to run in theſe terms. <hi>That the Pope hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to feed and to govern the Church Univerſal in place of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who hath imparted to him, as his Vicar General, all his Authority.</hi> And or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Legates that in the Chapter of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine they ſhould enlarge more upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make uſe of the Terms of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Florence;</hi> which ſaith that the Holy See, that is to ſay the Pope, has the Primacy over all the Church, that he is the Succeſſour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was Prince of the Apoſtles; that he is the true Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Head of all the Churches; the Father and Maſter of all Chriſtians, to whom the Lord hath given full power to govern the Church Univerſal. He enjoyned the Legates not to deviate from that form which had been au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by a General Council. At the ſame time, that he might prevent the deſigns of the <hi>French,</hi> who would have had a Pope elected by the Council, in caſe the preſent Pope had died, he publiſhed a Bull wherein he declared that having intention to goe to <hi>Bologna,</hi> in caſe he ſhould die in his Journey, he ordained that his Succeſſour ſhould not be choſen but at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> who was charged with the Memoires of the <hi>French,</hi> arrived a little time after the inſtructions of the Biſhop
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:99003:277"/>of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> had been diſpatched. The Pope very impatiently heard the Memoires read; but the Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo</hi> pacified him a little, by giving him hopes that if he condeſcended to ſome of theſe Articles, a part might be cut off, and the reſt moderated; but particularly he gave him eaſe when he aſſured him that the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops diſliked thoſe Reformations, and that they were ready to oppoſe them. The Pope held a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon that Subject: and it was therein reſolved that the Articles ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Doctours of the Canon Law, to make their obſervations upon them. At the ſame time the Pope ſent Orders to the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> his Legate in <hi>France,</hi> to repreſent to the King, that ſome of theſe Propoſitions tended to the Diminution of the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe they deprived the King of the Collation of Benefices, and amongſt others of Abbeys; that the diſpoſal of Benefices was a very commodious Privilege to him for rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his faithfull Servants: that to raiſe the Authority of Biſhops was not the way to ſtrengthen the Authority of the King; and that the more powerfull Biſhops were, the more troubleſome they were to Princes. He ſent his Legate likewiſe Orders to give the King the forty thouſand Crowns remaining unpay'd of the hundred thouſand which he had obliged himſelf to furniſh him; but with all that he ſhould not part from them but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Condition that he had till them requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I mean, the abolition of the Pragmatick Sanction in all the Parliaments. He prayed alſo the King to conſider that by diminiſhing
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:99003:277"/>the Revenues of the Holy See, he would be deprived of means to procure Reſpect and Obedience; that the Tithes of Tithes were by the Law due to the chief Prieſt, and that they had been wiſely converted into Annats: and concluded with an exhortation to the King that he would ſent new Inſtructions to his Ambaſſadours. He ſent likewiſe to <hi>Trent</hi> the Cenſures and Obſervations which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts and Divines had made upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires of the <hi>French.</hi>

The Legates diſtributed Copies of the Minute of the Decree which was ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> touching the Inſtitution of Biſhops, and declared that they would begin the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations again for conſulting about it.

Firſt this Clauſe was objected againſt, <hi>that Biſhops hold a chief rank depending on the Biſhop of Rome;</hi> that was thought to be an ambiguous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but after ſome debate they who made
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:99003:278"/>the objection conſented to have it ſaid, <hi>a chief rank under the Pope.</hi> Some alſo did not like that it ſhould be ſaid, that Biſhops are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Pope <hi>in partem ſolicitudinis;</hi> becauſe that ſignified clearly enough, that Biſhops are appointed by the Pope, and not by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but above all they ſtumbled at the Article of the Pope's Authority, and that the Canon gave him the Pope to govern the Church Univerſal. The <hi>French</hi> thought that by theſe words the Pope had a deſign to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Superiority over the Council. They were nevertheleſs willing it ſhould be ſaid that he hath the power to rule all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>eccleſias univerſas;</hi> but not the Church Univerſal, <hi>eccleſiam univerſalem.</hi> Moſt part fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied that to be a very nice diſtinction, and of little ſolidity. But the reſt maintained that by giving the Pope power to govern the Church Univerſal, they exalted his Tribunal above the Church, whereas the Tribunal of the Church is exalted above that of the Pope. They alledged that there was a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt being exalted above all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that is to ſay, above every Particular Church, and being exalted above the Church Univerſal, that is, whole Church taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and aſſembled in a Council.

Upon this occaſion there aroſe a great conteſt betwixt the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> for the <hi>Italians</hi> maintained that the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> was a General Council, that that of <hi>Baſil</hi> was Schiſmatical, and the other of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> partly approved, and partly rejected. But the <hi>French,</hi> on the contrary, denied the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> to have been a lawfull Council, and ſaid that the others of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> were lawfull and General. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates well perceived that no good would come of theſe conteſts; and therefore that they might have time to ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> the Cenſures which the Biſhops on the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> had made upon the Decree compoſed by the Pope, touching the Inſtitution of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Authority of the Holy See, they employed the Congregations about the Point of Reſidence. The Cardinals of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> and <hi>Madruccio</hi> the day before, had mode a Project of Deciſion concerning the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of Reſidence, which diſpleaſed not the Legates. But the Preſidents having had time to reflect upon it, obſerved a Clauſe that gave them Umbrage; which was, <hi>that Biſhops are obliged by the Command of God to guide their Flocks, and to watch in Perſon over them.</hi> They knew very well that the Pope would make a ſiniſter interpretation of theſe words, and think that they favoured the opinion of the Divine Right of Reſidence: and therefore they left it out, of their own heads, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Congregation the Minute cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected after their own way. That action choaked the Cardinals of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Madruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio:
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:99003:279"/>Lorrain</hi> proteſted that for the future he would not meddle in any thing, and Cardinal <hi>Madruccio</hi> ſaid, that in the Council there was another ſecret Council, which took all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to it ſelf. The Legates finding that they gained no ground, put a ſtop to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, in expectation of an anſwer from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope's Party began to make Factions that they might break up the Council for good and all. At this the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> broke out and acted with leſs reſerve than he had formerly done. He complained that there was a deſign of breaking up the Council; he ſpoke to the Ambaſſadours of Princes, that their Maſters might intercede with the Pope, not onely for the Continuation of the Council; but eſpecially that it might be left to its liberty, ſaying that nothing could be propoſed or reſolved upon but what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Legates, that the Legates did nothing but what the Pope thought fit, and that Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions even about the ſmalleſt matters muſt be expected from <hi>Rome:</hi> that if matters went on ſtill in that manner, they would make a paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in <hi>France,</hi> whereby all ſhould have liberty to live as they thought good, untill the holding of a free Council: that for his own part, he would have patience untill the next Seſſion; but that if affairs went no better, he would proteſt and withdraw, and carry all the <hi>French</hi> along with him, that they might celebrate a National Council at Home. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> made the ſame Expoſtulations and Menaces, that the Cardinal did at <hi>Trent.</hi> But the Pope began to be accuſtomed to that noiſe, and was not a
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:99003:279"/>whit ſtartled at theſe Bugbears of National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods. He made anſwer, that the Council was more than free, that it was even licentious; that if the <hi>Italians</hi> made any Factions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, he knew nothing of it, but that yet they were forced upon it, if they did ſo, by the violence of the Biſhops beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who endeavoured to trample under foot the Authority of the Holy See. The Biſhop of the five Churches the Emperour's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour for the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> went about the ſame time to wait on his Maſter, and to inform him of the Factions and Conduct of the <hi>Italians.</hi> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> and thoſe of his Party entreated him to procure from the Emperour a Letter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> praying him to ſolicite a Reformation. The Legates were informed of this, and looked upon all that Conduct, as an effect of the Councils of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and to Countermine that League, they deputed <hi>John Franciſco Commendone</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Zante</hi> to the Emperour, under pretext of Juſtifying the Council in that they had not as yet propoſed the Articles of Reformation which his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty had preſented b his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. Seeing theſe miſunderſtandings grew dayly greater and greater, the Legates ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perplexed ſent a writing to all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, begging the Aſſiſtance of their Councils in the preſent Junctures. The <hi>French</hi> ſlipt not that occaſion to tell their minds freely; and therefore ſaid that the Council was made uſe of to encreaſe corruptions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of leſſening them; that a ſtop ought to be put to thoſe ſhamefull underhand dealings
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:99003:280"/>which were continually practiſed, that they ought not to labour to raiſe the Pope above the Church Univerſal, that the beſt way was to follow the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> And farther added that one cauſe of diſagreement was that the Clark of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did not faithfully ſet down the opinions, and that therefore he ought to have an Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. The Imperialiſts made Remonſtrances much of the ſame nature, and particularly preſſed the neceſſity of Joyning an Aſſiſtant to the Clark of the Council. The other mean low ſpirited Ambaſſadours made anſwer in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, that they muſt continue the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and endeavour an Union amongſt the Members.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt affairs were in this condition, the Council being under a kind of ſuſpenſion, and no Congregation held, the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> returned from <hi>Rome</hi> fraighted with Civilities and Complements from the Pope to all the Prelates, and proviſions alſo of Employments and Penſions which the Pope gave to ſome of the Council. The Biſhop of <hi>Aoſta</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> arrived, and the Legates perceiving that they gained nothing by interrupting the Congregations, and that it gave ground for murmurings and private Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, where the ſpirit of diſcord and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grew dayly ſtronger and ſtronger, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to begin Congregations again, and to take the occaſion of receiving the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Savoy.</hi> They therefore ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia</hi> to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to know of him if there were no means to ſatisfie the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> and to tell him that the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:99003:280"/>terms of <hi>governing the Church Univerſal,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they took ſo great offence, are uſed by St. <hi>Bernard</hi> an Author which the Cardinal very much approved of. The Cardinal anſwered ſteadfaſtly, that the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops did their Duty, that all <hi>France</hi> fixed their eyes upon them to obſerve their Conduct: that the <hi>French</hi> would never ſuffer that kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which gives the Pope the Power of governing the Univerſal Church; and that if it were again propoſed, the Ambaſſadours would not fail to proteſt in name of the King and of ſixſcore Biſhops; becauſe it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the received opinion in <hi>France,</hi> that the Pope ought to be ſubject to a Council. When the Legates had received this anſwer, they loſt all hopes of gaining the <hi>French:</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo grew more and more inflexible, and <hi>Martin Gazdellun,</hi> whom we mentioned before, being lately come from <hi>Spain,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them in their ſteadfaſtneſs: for having examined how all things went, he ſaid, that he evidently perceived that the Council was not free, and commending the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> for his vigour and conſtancy, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that the King was extremely well ſatisfied with his Conduct, and that if the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo</hi> came to be void, his Majeſty would beſtow it upon him. For all that, they began to hold Congregations again, and in one of the laſt of <hi>January</hi> the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>Savoy</hi> was publickly received, where he made and received the uſual Complements. The Congregations continued, and ſo did their Diviſions alſo. The Pope's Party were cloſely lincked together, and thoſe who were
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:99003:281"/>not ſo favourable to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> on the other hand, ſtood firm in their deſign of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the inſtitution of Epiſcopacy and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence declared to be of Divine Right. The Legates and the reſt of the Pope's Party ſaw that it was no time to carry it by open force; they reſolved therefore to let the heats cool, and to tire out ſome, ſo as to make them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to blunt the edge of others by long attendance and delay, and ſo they took a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of putting off the Seſſion. They got the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to condeſcend to that delay, but very aukwardly; for he ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the Factions and private Cabals of the <hi>Italians,</hi> proteſted that he conſented to that delay onely out of complaiſance. The buſineſs was propoſed in Congregation the third of <hi>February</hi> by the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua.</hi> It was oppoſed, but the Legates at length car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, that the Seſſion ſhould be Prorogued till the two and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> after <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was nor vexed at that reſolution, though he ſeemed to take it ill. For he was glad that matters might be protracted, that he might ſee what became of the Pope who was old and always valitudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He deſired alſo to know how the affairs of <hi>France</hi> went, that he might accordingly adjuſt his meaſures. During this Interval the Legates reſolved to bring under examination the matter of Marriage; and though the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours inſtantly urged that they might treat of Reformation, they could not obtain it: for the Preſidents were reſolved to ſpin out the time, about matters that ſew were any way concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in.</p>

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:99003:282"/>and encreaſed the Suſpicions againſt <hi>France.</hi> The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſenſible that the Cardinal was very ill ſatisfied with the Council; and when he parted from <hi>Trent</hi> he wrote as much to the Pope himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him of the Factions and Conduct of the Council, telling his Holineſs, with all, that if things continued to be carried after that rate, all that he could doe was to pray that God Almighty would inſpire the Council. It was very well known likewiſe that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's intentions were as far from favouring the Pope as thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> were, and that was another allarm. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo feared that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might have a deſign of conferring with the Emperour, and King of the <hi>Romans</hi> about means for obtaining the Conceſſion of the Cup; for they had good intelligence that the <hi>German</hi> Princes and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours intended to make new inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Council about it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the ninth the Legates held the firſt Congregation about the Doctrine of Marriage. The Divines of the firſt Chamber examined the firſt two Articles; and Father <hi>Salmeron</hi> a Jeſuit ſpoke with much Pomp, and for all that, ſaid but very ordinary things. Having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that Marriage is a true Sacrament; he paſt to the ſecond Article that relates to Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:99003:282"/>Marriages, and alledged in favour of them, the Authority of the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> which declares that the Validity of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages depends ſolely upon the Conſent of the Parties who contract, and this Oratour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the opinion of thoſe who aſſert that Fathers and Mothers may annull them ought to be condemned as an Hereſie: but allowed the Church the Power of reſcinding ſuch Marriages becauſe ſhe is the Miſtreſſ of the Sacraments, and that it is expedient to annull them to prevent the diſorders which thoſe unfortunate Marriages cauſe in Families. Next day <hi>Maillard</hi> Dean of the Faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> made a long diſcourſe, and concluded with <hi>Salmeron</hi> that Marriage is a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but as to Clandeſtine Marriages he was not of <hi>Salmeron</hi>'s opinion. For he maintained that the Church had not that Power over the Sacraments as to make a Sacrament that was lawfull at one time, to become unlawfull at another. He alledged. for proof the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt, ſaying that the Church could not make a Conſecrated Wafer ceaſe to be a Real Sacrament, after that it had been ſome time kept; ſince it was ſo at firſt. He went through all the Sacraments, proving that the Church hath not power to invalidate a Sacrament lawfully adminiſtred. He ſhew'd that in all times private Marriages had been valid, and that no man ever thought of annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them. His opinion took extremely well; but eſpecially the Pope's Party took great pleaſure to hear the <hi>French</hi> Doctour ſpeaking of the Pope, call him, <hi>the Directour and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour of the</hi> Roman, <hi>that is to ſay the Univerſal
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:99003:283"/>Church.</hi> They drew great advantage from that Confeſſion, and ſaid that it ought to be obſerved againſt the Cavils which the Prelates of the ſame Nation made upon occaſion of the Canon about the Authority of the Pope, wherein they would not ſuffer it to be ſaid, that he hath Power to <hi>rule the Church Univerſal.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſaid that there was a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt theſe expreſſions, <hi>rule the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church</hi> abſolutely, and rule <hi>the</hi> Roman, <hi>that is to ſay, the Univerſal Church,</hi> becauſe the term <hi>Univerſal</hi> is onely employed to explain that of <hi>Roman,</hi> and that ſo it ought to extend no farther. It cannot be denied, but that the diſtinction is very nice and fine ſpun, and that the difference betwixt thoſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions is not very, ſenſible; it had been as well, perhaps, if <hi>Maillard</hi> had frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that it dropt from him before he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. In the Congregation of the Eleventh of <hi>February</hi> the <hi>French</hi> preſented a Letter from their King, wherein he acquainted the, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with the Victory that he had obtained over the Enemies of the Catholick Religion, and at the ſame time demanded Reformation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Letters were read, the Ambaſſadour <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> made a Speech:<note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> his Letter to the Council, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a Speech of <hi>du Ferrier.</hi>
                     </note> and having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Calamities of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and the neceſſity of doing ſomewhat to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy them, he ſaid that the proper remedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Council, and that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in endeavouring that, ought to turn their Eyes towards the Holy Scripture, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians now-a-days were like the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> of the Town of <hi>Sichar,</hi> who would believe becauſe they ſaw, and not barely upon
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:99003:283"/>the report of a Woman, that every body at preſent ſtudied the Scriptures. That they ſhould not think it ſtrange if in their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they had omitted the moſt neceſſary Points, that they had begun with the ſmalleſt, but that they had more important matters to propoſe: that if they intended to ſet about the Work of Reformation, they muſt do it in good earneſt, and that the Fathers who were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ought to conſider what was the Succeſs of thoſe ſlight and weak Reformations of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and that which came after, which he was not willing to name, for fear of offending their ears. He meant the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> whereof the name is odious to all the Favourers of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> He laid before them alſo that the Councils of <hi>Florence, Lateran,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Trent</hi> had done nothing for the Church, and in that they did nothing, they had done a great deal of hurt, and given occaſion to a Schiſm of ſo many People as are ſeparated from it. They gave the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour a civil anſwer, though in his Speech he had given ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nips which touch'd the Pope's Party to the quick. He ſaid <hi>that he preſented the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Reformation principally to the Council.</hi> Theſe words offended them extremely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did inſinuate that the Ambaſſadour made far leſs reckoning of the Pope, than he did of the Council. Beſides, they found that by that expreſſion he deſigned to have a laſh at the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus Legatis:</hi> as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to intimate that in Quality of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour he pretended to propoſe his Articles to the Council himſelf, and not by the Lagates;
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:99003:284"/>and this perſwaded them that <hi>France</hi> entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned terrible intentions againſt the Authority of the Pope, and they were the more allar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med becauſe <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> had ſaid that the <hi>French</hi> had ſtill far more important Propoſals to make, and that they ought to make greater advances in the work of Reformation than the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> had done. The day following the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> parted for <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> taking with him nine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and four Divides; but he got a promiſe from the Legates that during his abſence they ſhould not treat of the Marriage of Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time they continued the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations about the matter of Doctrine. The firſt Chamber of Divines which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, having heard <hi>Salmeron</hi> and <hi>Maillard,</hi> unanimouſly condemned as Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal the opinion that denies Marriage to be a Sacrament, and in like manner declared Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriages to be true Sacraments, and lawfull Marriages. But there was ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinion about the Sentiments of <hi>Salmeron</hi> and <hi>Maillard,</hi> in relation to the Power of the Church in annulling ſecret Marriages: ſome were of <hi>Salmeron</hi>'s opinion; and others with <hi>Maillard,</hi> thought that the Power of the Church did not reach ſo far, as to make a Marriage become unlawfull, which was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a very little before. Amongſt thoſe who maintained that the Church had Power to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null Clandeſtine Marriages, ſome diſputed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Point, to wit, whether it be convenient and profitable to make uſe of that Power in the preſent time. But moſt part thought it
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:99003:284"/>beſt, that all ſecret Marriages ſhould be invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated; and ſome went farther ſtill, and were for declaring null and void all Marriages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Children of Perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Quality, without the Conſent of their Parents, as well for ſtrengthening Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Authority, as for preventing the Miſchiefs which many times attend ſuch Marriages.</p>
                  <p>The Divines of the ſecond Chamber exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the third and fourth Articles, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Divorce, Polygamy, and the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to marry in certain times. Father <hi>Soto</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh Jacobin</hi> maintained that it was not lawfull to diſſolve a Marriage, nay not for the Cauſe of Adultery. He confeſſed that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Folks might be ſeparated from bed and board; but not ſo as to allow thoſe who are ſo ſeparated to marry with others; he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that to be the meaning of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he permits married Believers to remain ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, in caſe their unbelieving Wives will not live with them. He gave ſeveral interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ſeem to allow a Divorce for the Cauſe of Adultery, but ſtuck to none of them, which was a great Argument that he was not ſo clear in that Point, as he would have ſeemed to be. As to Polygamy, he proved is to be contrary to the Law of Nature; and for the Prohibitions to marry in certain times, he ſaid there was no need to make a grievance of that, ſeeing it was eaſie to obtain a Diſpenſation from the Biſhop to marry in prohibited times. About the ſubſtance of the queſtion there was no great diſpute: but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Divines caught hold of that occaſion to ſpeak of the neceſſity
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:99003:285"/>of the Reſidence of Biſhops, that they might be able to give Diſpenſations with Prudence, Wiſedom, and with Knowledge of the Cauſe. Upon naming the Tie that is betwixt a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and a Wife, which is like to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Biſhop is united to his Church; a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier</hi> named <hi>John Ramirez</hi> took occaſion to ſpeak again about Reſidence, and ſhew'd that it was no more in the Pope's Power to draw a Biſhop from his See, and tranſlate him into another, than to ſnatch a Husband from his Wife. The Pope's Party, on the contrary, took occaſion to ſpeak of the Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Holy See, upon account that the two Articles which were under Debate, ſtand condemned in the Decretals of Popes. They magnified that Authority beyond all bounds, and ſtretched it even to the diſpenſing againſt Canons, againſt the Ordinances of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and againſt all the Laws of God.

                  <p>When the ſecond Chamber had ſpoken, the Legates paſt by the third, and came to the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:99003:285"/>fourth, becauſe they had promiſed the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> not to meddle with the Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of Prieſts, the Examination whereof was committed to the third Chamber. The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fourth Chamber was to treat of the Degrees of Conſanguinity: and <hi>John de Verdun</hi> a <hi>French Benedictine,</hi> giving his opinion upon the matter, took in hand to refute what had been ſaid in favour of the Pope, about Diſpenſations, and ſpoke all that he durſt to weaken the Papal Authority. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that in Humane Laws there was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Diſpenſations, becauſe Legiſlatours can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not foreſee all Caſes; but he abſolutely denied that the Law of God could be diſpenſed with. The Pope, ſaid he, is not Maſter, and the Church is not his Servant; and Diſpenſations ought onely to be the Explanations of Laws, and by Conſequence ought not to overthrow them; ſo that the Pope by diſpenſing cannot take off the obligation that lies upon men to obey the Law. <hi>James Alain</hi> a Divine of the Biſhop of <hi>Vannes</hi> ſpoke with the ſame vigour, and ſunk the Authority of the Pope below a Council, affirming that the Power of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was properly given to the Church,<note place="margin">The Emperour much diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Council and the Pope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pope, and the Liberty of the Council.</note> and not immediately to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe queſtions were debated amongſt the Divines, the Prelates minded other Affairs. <hi>Commendene</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Zante</hi> whom the Legates had ſent to the Emperour returned to <hi>Trent</hi> without any Succeſs in his Negotiation, for the Emperour deſired time to anſwer the Propoſitions which the Legates had made to him. However this Deputy found, that the Emperour was extremely diſſatisfied with the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:99003:286"/>Council, and that he was reſolved to take ſome Courſe to remedy the Diſorders that reigned in it; that he intended to demand a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Reformation, and to ſettle it ſo firmly, that none ſhould be able to ſhake it. He told the Preſidents alſo that he made no doubt but that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had intelligence with the Emperour; becauſe the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> deſigned for the Embaſſie of <hi>Trent,</hi> had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe who complained of the boldneſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, that he could not meddle in it, and that theſe Prelates ſpoke according to their Conſcience. They were therefore ſatisfied in General that the Emperour aimed at great matters, but could not preciſely tell what they might be. Theſe Secrets were not long ſhrouded under the veil of ſecrecy; for one Father <hi>Camiſco</hi> a Jeſuit, and another Father <hi>Nattale</hi> ſent from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Inſpruck</hi> by General <hi>Lainez</hi> ſounded the bottom of theſe Myſteries. They found that the Emperour had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeventeen Articles to be conſulted by his Divines and Counſellours. For inſtance, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was convenient that the Pope ſhould be ſo much Maſter of the Council as he was, ſo that nothing ſhould be propoſed, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded but what the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> pleaſed. Whether the Pope happening to die, the Election of his Succeſſour did not belong to the Council. What is the Power of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour when the See is vacant, and the Council open. Whether Ambaſſadours ought not to have a deliberative Vote in Council, when they treat of matters that regard the Peace of Chriſtendom. Whether the Pope could diſſolve or ſuſpend the Council without the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:99003:286"/>Conſent of the Emperour and Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Whether it ought to be ſuffered that the Legates alone ſhould have the Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. What means ought to be uſed to ſet the Council at Liberty, and to prevent all violence and fraud therein. What Courſe ought to be taken to repreſs the inſolence of the <hi>Italians</hi> who ſtopt all deliberations, and to prevent their private Cabals. By what means ought the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to be hindered from ordering what is to be done in the Council. And whether it would conſiſt with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Emperour to be preſent at the Council. Theſe Articles were communicated to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the Conferences held on that ſubject produced no other effect, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt the Pope who was informed of all by his Spies, and was offended that the Emperour took the Liberty to conſult about Points that were ſo prejudicial to his Authority. He was adviſed to ſhew his Reſentment by a ſevere and ſmart Brief. Such as <hi>Paul</hi> III. had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, upon occaſion of the Conferences of <hi>Spire.</hi> But having well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that, he thought it better to wink at the matter. In the mean time the Cardinals had long Conſultations at <hi>Rome</hi> about the Articles of the <hi>French,</hi> whether they ought to be propoſed in the Council or not; and it was concluded in the Negative. It was alledged that ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> had new matters and of greater importance to propoſe, it was to be feared that if they appeared to be ſo eaſie in admitting theſe, it might give them the boldneſs to goe on with the reſt.

                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:99003:287"/>In relation to the ſecond queſtion, whether it was expedient at preſent to diſpenſe with the Law of a ſingle life in favour of the Prieſts, or even to aboliſh it; there were ſome Divines, who maintained that it would be expedient, becauſe of the horrid diſorders of the Lives of Prieſts; and they failed not to quote that famous ſaying of <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> who was afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II. That for good reaſons the Church had prohibited Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Prieſts: but that for other and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſons it ought to be allowed them. It was carried by Plurality of Votes, that a Prieſt might be diſpenſed with to marry. However it was not the Pope's mind that that opinion ſhould paſs: and therefore the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were blamed at <hi>Rome,</hi> for having ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that queſtion to be diſputed. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed themſelves, ſaying, that they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have that Deference for the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the Emperour and Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> who had inſtantly ſolicited it. The <hi>French</hi> perceiving that moſt part were of opinion that a Prieſt might be diſpenſed with to marry, had ſome deſign to demand a diſpenſation for the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> But the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was not of that mind, perhaps it was not much his deſire that the Heirs of the Family of <hi>Bourbon</hi> ſhould multiply. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he gave why he was not for it, was the difficulty of obtaining it, becauſe ſuch Diſpenſations cannot be granted but upon very urgent occaſions, which was not to be alledged in this Caſe, ſeeing there were a great many Princes of the bloud.</p>

                     <pb n="489" facs="tcp:99003:287"/>The Pope received the news of the death of the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and if one may judge by appearances, he was not very much troubled at it,<note place="margin">The Pope names two Legates in place of the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua.</hi> He will not name the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for Preſident.</note> for he did not look upon him as too much addicted to the intereſts of the Holy See. He would not follow the advice of Cardinal <hi>Simoneta,</hi> who could have heartily wiſhed that no new Legate had been ſent to <hi>Trent;</hi> for inſtead of one he named two. But that he might not be contradicted in that Election, he made the nomination when no body expected it: and it fell upon Cardinal <hi>Giovanni Morone,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Navagiero.</hi> He kept that nomination ſecret, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to avoid the Perſecution of the <hi>French,</hi> who pretended that that Dignity belonged to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>de la Bourdaiſiere</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man who was at <hi>Rome</hi> moved it to the Pope, who anſwered him briskly, that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was at <hi>Trent</hi> as head of a Party, and that a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed Perſon muſt be ſet at the head of the Council. About the ſame time the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> received at <hi>Trent</hi> the news of the death of his Brother, who was aſſaſſinated before <hi>Orleans</hi> by a Piſtol ſhot, of which he died ſix days after.

Both of them offered to purge themſelves of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation before any Judges that ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them. This blow allarmed the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and made him double his Guards: and ſeeing he offered at every thing, Wit and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:99003:288"/>as well as ſtate Policy, he wrote to his Siſter-in-Law a long conſolatory Letter; of which his Servants to doe their Maſter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, diſperſed a great many Copies.

                     </list> This Letter gave offence to the Pope and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to all. It was wondered at, that the Emperour durſt offer to ſpeak with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than any of his Predeceſſours ever had done, not excepting <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who with all his Power and Greatneſs, had never ventured to be ſo bold: and the Pope was the more vexed, that the Emperour having ſent a Copy of that Letter to the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had made it publick. At the ſame time the Emperour's Chancellour plainly told the <hi>Nuncio</hi> reſiding at the Imperial Court, that the words <hi>Univerſalem Eccleſiam</hi> muſt be left out of the Decree that we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; becauſe they defined the Superiority of the Pope over a Council. All thoſe things together incenſed the Pope againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. He anſwered him in the ſame ſtrain, and let him know, that he alone had the Power of calling Councils; that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was free enough; but that in all times the Popes had ſent their Inſtructions to Councils; that the Pope and his Legates, had the ſole Power of propoſing; that the diſorders came from thoſe who kept Conventicles and Cabals for encroaching upon the Authority of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See; that he himſelf ſolicited alſo a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but that it was fit that they who were ſo preſſing with others for Reformation, would begin with themſelves; That the Emperour had taken pains to obſerve very well the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:99003:289"/>of the Council, but that he had forgot the greateſt; and that was, that they who ought to receive the Law from the Council, would needs give it, and that if Princes would have imitated the <hi>Conſtantins</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s, there would have been no Diviſion. Beſides that Letter, the Pope ſent the Emperour a Paper containing many paſſages to warrant the Clauſe of the Decree which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wherein he attributed to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> the right of governing <hi>Univerſam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam,</hi> the Church Univerſal. The Emperour, on the other hand, ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> a Collection of other paſſages, which overthrew thoſe of the Pope, and oppugned the Clauſe which he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> undertaken to defend. By this Conduct of the Emperour, the Pope found that it was impoſſible that ever they could joyn in intereſts, and therefore he abandoned both him and the <hi>French,</hi> and turned all his hopes and proſpects towards <hi>Spain.</hi> The Pope's Letter to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour having been divulged, it diſpleaſed the <hi>French:</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his Prelates ſeveral times, to examine and refute the paſſages which the Pope alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his Writing for aſſerting the Clauſe <hi>regens Univerſalem Eccleſiam.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> did the like, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not joyn with them in this particular, becauſe they receive the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> kept them from writing to the Pope, to give him aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their Fidelity; it's enough, ſaid he, that the Pope knows we are not againſt him,<note place="margin">The death of Cardinal <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripando.</hi>
                     </note> though we do not fawn with <hi>Italian</hi> Flattery. Cardinal <hi>Seripando</hi> died the ſeventeenth of
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:99003:289"/>
                     <hi>March,</hi> and that gave a new Pretext for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Actions of the Council. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours next day after the death of that Cardinal went to move again for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; but the Legates made anſwer that they were not able alone to undertake ſo weighty an affair, and therefore prayed them to expect the coming of the Cardinals <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> and <hi>Navagiero</hi> their Collegues. They were forced to acquieſce, and the <hi>Germans</hi> were not angry at the delay, becauſe the Emperour's Ambaſſadours were at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Don Lewis d'Avila</hi> was arrived on the part of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The inſtructions of theſe Ambaſſadours were, to treat with the Pope in name of their Maſters about Reformation, and to demand that the Council might be free, ſo as that all ſhould have freedom to propoſe. Now the <hi>Germans</hi> deſired to know what that might produce before they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded farther. The Pope who now repoſed all his Confidence on the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> made extraordinary much of <hi>Don Lewis d'Avila;</hi> and at the ſame time by the Solicitations of his <hi>Nuncio</hi> obtained a Letter from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> which orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to repreſs the boldneſs of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Prelates. In compliance with this Letter the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> who was at that time at the Emperour's Court, wrote to <hi>Martin Gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellun</hi> Secretary of the Embaſſie, and to the Archbiſhops and Biſhops of <hi>Granada, Leon</hi> and <hi>Segovia,</hi> that they ſhould take care, that the Prelates of <hi>Spain</hi> did favour the intereſts of the Pope. In the mean while the Conference of the Ambaſſadours with the Pope had no
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:99003:290"/>effect, partly becauſe he had no real intention to ſatisfie them, and partly becauſe what the one deſired the others withſtood. The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts demanded the Cup, and the Marriage of Prieſts, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppoſed it. The Pope waved the Propoſitions that they made to him about Reformation, and anſwered in general terms, that he left the Council to their liberty, and that the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis</hi> ſhould be interpreted, ſo as to give all content. In effect he wrote to his Legates at <hi>Trent,</hi> that they ſhould not hinder the Prelates to propoſe what they thought fit: but in the mean time, Cardinal <hi>Morone,</hi> as was well known, had inſtructions quite contrary to theſe fair promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The twentieth of <hi>March</hi> the Congregations of Divines about the point of Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and the Legates met to conſult with the Prelates of the Pope's Faction, whether they ſhould begin the Congregations of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. The Cardinal of <hi>Warmia</hi> was not againſt it; but was even of opinion that they ſhould endeavour to put an end to one or other of the ſix difficulties which had been ſtarted, and had ſo long puzled the Council, that ſo the ſticklers might have patience as to the reſt. Theſe ſix difficulties were: Firſt about the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis,</hi> which was deſired might be recalled and expunged. Secondly, concerning Reſidence. Thirdly, about the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether Epiſcopacy be of Divine Right. Fourthly, concerning the Authority of the Pope. Fifthly, touching the propoſition of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Aſſiſtant to the Clark of the Council; And Sixthly, about the demand of a general
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:99003:290"/>Reformation. Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> who was afraid of the eaſineſs of the Cardinal of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and who would not expoſe himſelf ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly to the Torrent of ſo much contradiction, was of the opinion that they ſhould expect the Legates who were to come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and his advice carried it. So all things were in ſuſpence, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took this opportunity to goe and take his Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>Venice,</hi> to comfort himſelf for the death of his two Brothers; for ſince the death of the Duke, he had receiv'd news of the death of the Grand Prior.</p>

                     </note>The Pope, in the mean while, thought of means how he might rid his hands of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and repeated inſtances that were made to him about the buſineſs of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hitherto he ſeemed undetermined in relation to the Propoſitions of the <hi>French;</hi> he had neither admitted nor rejected them: in general terms he had promiſed to conſider of them, and that they ſhould be propoſed in time and place convenient. He ſeemed to have ſome inclination to grant ſuch things as ſtruck not at the diminution of the Authority of the Holy See; as the Marriage of Prieſts, the Communion in both kinds, and the Service in the vulgar Tongue. But after he had weighed all things well, he found that he could not make any ſtep towards ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which would not prove fatal; that when once a breach ſhould be made in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrines, the Adverſaries would croud in apace at it, and that would give occaſion to new Demands.

                     <hi>French,</hi> and that he might make it the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he thought fit, once again to make an eſſay of dividing the Emperour from the <hi>French.</hi> For that effect, he ordered Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> Legate Elect for the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> not to ſtay there but to goe to the Emperour's Court: and at the ſame time; becauſe the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had dropt ſome words that did inſinuate, as if the Emperour ſhould have ſome deſign to come to <hi>Bologna,</hi> and to be Crowned there by the Pope, he reſolved to ſound the Cardinal as to that Point, and to endeavour to engage him in that Negotiation. The Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia,</hi> under pretext of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting one of his Nephews that lay ſick at <hi>Padua,</hi> went to meet the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in that Town, as he was upon his Journey to <hi>Venice.</hi> The Cardinal confirmed what he had ſaid of the Emperour; but when ho found that they had a deſign to engage him to be concerned in the buſineſs of bringing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to <hi>Bologna,</hi> there to receive the Crown from the hands of the Pope, he wavered, and ſaid that when he came back to <hi>Trent,</hi> he would endeavour to prie into the Intentions of his Imperial Majeſty; but that he did not believe that the Princes of the Empire would approve that deſign, and that the Emperour would doe nothing that might diſpleaſe them. Having ſaid ſo, he turned the diſcourſe, and told the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia,</hi> that his deſign was to preſs the Reformation when the new Legates were come, ſaying that he doubted not but that they came fully informed of the intentions of the Pope, and that then it would clearly appear whether his Holineſs in good
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:99003:291"/>earneſt deſired that Reformation; that upon the whole, if they intended that matters ſhould goe better, there were fifty Biſhops in the Council who were to be turned out, becauſe they were ſworn to oppoſe all good reſolutions.

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:99003:293"/>making of the peace by the neceſſity of the times, which admits of no Law. But theſe excuſes ſatisfied not the Council; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Biſhops could not digeſt that the King in the Preface of the Edict of that Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, did ſay, that he had hopes that either a General or National Council would ſpeedily compoſe all the publick troubles; for that did inſinuate, as if he diſtruſted the ſucceſs of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and tacitely threatned the calling of a National Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>The two and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> had been pitcht upon for holding of the Seſſion: and the day before, a General Congregation was called, wherein the Legates were of opinion that it ſhould be deferred untill the third of <hi>June.</hi> But the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> objected, that it was a ſhame to aſſign ſo often the day of the Seſſion and never to hold it, that therefore it was not fit any more to prefix a day, but that the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> following the Council might meet and conſider of a day when it could be held.

They ſaid that the Pope had a great deal of reaſon to call him, the Head of a Party; that he alone obſtructed the expedition of affairs in Council, and the Tranſlation of it to <hi>Bologna.</hi> But as to the prolongation of the Council, and delay of the Seſſion, the Legates concurred in that as freely as any, in hopes that the more Zealous would either be gone, or abate their fervour.</p>

This was the anſwer that was publiſhed; but they who knew better the Secret Tranſactions of that Conference affirmed for a certain, that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Morone</hi> had brought the Emperour and King of the <hi>Romans</hi> to conſent to the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council.

<pb n="507" facs="tcp:99003:294"/>that it ſhould be ſuffered to diſperſe it ſelf by little and little, for avoiding a ſcandalous Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

They choſe rather to retreat without noiſe, becauſe they were ſomewhat aſhamed that they had not believed that noted Saying of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen;</hi> That the troubles of the Church are always encreaſed by the Aſſemblies of Biſhops: and they were unwilling to make open Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they were deceived in the Hopes that they had conceived of a Reformation.</p>

But beſides that that was falſe, he durſt not inſiſt upon it, becauſe that did a general prejudice to all Princes who had Ambaſſadours there.

                     <hi>French</hi> might be conſidered as a Party, and for that reaſon could not aſſiſt at the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations. The Subject that was choſen was, the prejudice that might befall Chriſtendom by the Peace concluded in <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of that reſolution; and thereupon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the <hi>French,</hi> to acquaint them, that there was ground to fear, leſt in theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, which were onely held for Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to hinder them from aſſiſting at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, ſome things might however be ſpoken, and reſolutions taken contrary to the intereſts of their Prince; and upon that Conſideration he made them reſolve to yield, and ſuffer the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> to have a place out of the rank of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. The <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> were not at all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that eaſineſs and condeſcenſion of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> However it went ſo, and on the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> the Count <hi>de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> took his place in the middle of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; in a ſeat by himſelf apart from all the reſt, and over againſt the Legates. For all that, he made his Proteſtations, ſaying, that the next place to the Ambaſſadours of the Emperour belonged to him, but that he was not willing to diſpute it, leſt he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give hinderance to the affairs of the Church and of the Council; that he pretended and declared that all that was done ſhould not be prejudicial to the rank which his Maſter ought to hold. On the other ſide, the <hi>French</hi> made their Proteſtations alſo, and proved that the Ambaſſadours of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had place immediately after the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours

Some propoſed that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour ſhould have the firſt place after the Cardinal Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con who was on the left hand; others, that he ſhould have a ſeat at the lower end of the Bench of the Cardinal Deacons. But that accommodation did not remove difficulties, no more than that which had been made at <hi>Trent.</hi> For the Ambaſſadours could not avoid Competition, when the Pope's Train was to be carried, and water preſented him to waſh his hands on the days when he did celebrate Pontifically.

<pb n="514" facs="tcp:99003:298"/>carry up the Train, and preſent water: the ſame Competition muſt happen alſo when they were to receive the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax.</hi> It was propoſed to give the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax</hi> to all thoſe who ſate on the Ambaſſadour's ſide, even to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Florence</hi> who was the laſt, before they went to the left where the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> was. That did not pleaſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, nor was it accepted by the <hi>French,</hi> who declared that either the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour ſhould abſent himſelf, or that he ſhould ſit below him, and if otherwiſe he would inſtantly leave <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he could not content them by that means, reſolved to let the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour know, that he would continue the King of <hi>France</hi> in the Privilege of Precedence, which he had enjoyed time out of mind. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſadour deſired leave to proteſt, and did ſo. He was introduced into the Pope's Chamber with four Witneſſes, and kneeling before his Holineſs, he made his Proteſtation, wherein he told his Holineſs that the King his Maſter ought to goe before the King of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe of the Antiquity and Greatneſs of his Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> and for the many other Kingdoms whereof he was Sovereign, and eſpecially becauſe he had ſo ſuccesfully defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Catholick Faith; and that therefore he oppoſed all Declaration of Precedency or Parity, which might be made in favour of the King of <hi>France,</hi> as being null, and contrary to the Right of the King his Maſter. The Pope anſwered him, that he had done nothing, but preſerved to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> the
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:99003:298"/>Right whereof it was in poſſeſſion, that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he would refer the matter to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Cardinals, and that he was ready on all occaſions to ſerve the Catholick King. The Pope perſiſted not long in the humour of doeing the <hi>French</hi> Juſtice, but was quickly overſwayed by the Ambaſſadour <hi>Vargas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the account of what was done at <hi>Rome:</hi> let us now return to what was done in the Council. They had found a Place for the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> that he might be preſent at the Congregations; but that inferred nothing for the day of the Seſſion, which is properly the day of Ceremony, when all the Actions and Perſons ought to be placed in their Order. The <hi>French</hi> were therefore reſolved to make new Inſtances to oblige the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> to take his place after them that day. Beſides that, there was a neceſſity that one or other muſt be firſt when the Council ſhould hold a Chapel, and when the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax</hi> were to be given, and the <hi>French</hi> could not imagine that they would give them to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> before them. The Pope to adjuſt that difficulty, at the Inſtance of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote to the Legates, that in the next Seſſion they ſhould give the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> a Place apart from the other Ambaſſadours, as had already been done in the Congregations, and that the firſt time they ſhould hold a Chapel, for avoiding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition in giving the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax,</hi> they ſhould have two Cenſers, and that they ſhould cenſe the two Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at the ſame time; that the like ſhould be done as to the <hi>Pax,</hi> that they ſhould
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:99003:299"/>have two <hi>Paxes</hi> preſented ſeverally to the two Ambaſſadours to be kiſt at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time; and for preventing of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealings and intrigues that might be practiſed to hinder the effect of that reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ordered the Legates to keep it ſecret. In effect Cardinal <hi>Morone,</hi> according to the Pope's Inſtructions, kept the thing ſo ſecret, that the <hi>French</hi> had not the leaſt notice of it. And on the nine and twentieth of <hi>June</hi> when all were aſſembled in the Chapel or Dome to hear Maſs, Service being begun, on the ſudden a Purple Velvet-Chair was brought out of the Veſtry, and placed in the rank oppoſit to that of the Ambaſſadours, betwixt the youngeſt Cardinal and eldeſt Patriarch, and at the ſame time the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> came and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf in that ſeat. The <hi>French</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately complained of it, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took it exceedingly ill, that ſuch a thing ſhould have been offered to be done, without acquainting him: The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours ſent the Maſter of the Ceremonies to make the ſame Complaint on their Parts, and at the ſame time proteſted that they would receive the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax</hi> firſt. They told them that it ſhould be remedied by two Cenſers and two <hi>Paxes.</hi> But they oppoſed that, and declared that they would admit of no Parity, and that they would retain the Poſſeſſion of Precedency. This buſtle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and going and loud whiſperings, cauſed a dull and confuſed noiſe that hindered the hearing of the Epiſtle and Goſpel read. But when Sermon was begun, the Legates called into the Veſtry, the Cardinals, Imperial Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:99003:299"/>and <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France.</hi> And all the Sermon-time was ſpent in Debates, without any Concluſion. At length the Biſhop of the five Churches and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>Poland</hi> came out, and prayed the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> in name of the Legates, that he would condeſcend that for that day there ſhould be no giving neither of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe nor <hi>Pax;</hi> promiſing that the firſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient day, and upon the firſt Demand that he ſhould make of it, they ſhould give him that ſatisfaction which the Pope had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but that they had need of ſome time to conſult how they might avoid Trouble and Confuſion. The Count <hi>de Luna</hi> conſented, and ſo ſoon as the <hi>Ite miſſa eſt</hi> was ſaid, whereas in all the Congregations he uſed to go out laſt of all, he went out the firſt even before the Croſs, followed by a great many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates, and <hi>Italians</hi> of his Maſter's Subjects. The Legates to juſtifie what they had done, ſhew'd the Commiſſion which they had received from the Pope. <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> fell into a Paſſion, and ſaid that had it not been for the reſpect he bore to the Holy Action they were about, he would have then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted; and declared that for the future he would doe it, if they did not give him the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax</hi> according to the Order of Precedency that belonged to him. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> wrote a very ſmart Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about it to the Pope, and complained in high terms, that the Pope having promiſed to doe nothing without firſt acquainting him, they made notwithſtanding a Myſtery even of things wherein he had a particular intereſt.
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:99003:300"/>The Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> on his part, complained of the Obſtinacy of the <hi>French,</hi> and preſſed the Legates, that on <hi>Sunday</hi> following the Ceremonies might be performed with a Parity to both, according to the Orders of the Pope. Next day after this Scuffle he called together the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates, and <hi>Italians</hi> of his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Subjects, and repreſented to them the Neceſſity of ſhewing themſelves vigorous on this occaſion; that the <hi>French</hi> would not fail to proteſt, either againſt the Legates, or againſt the King his Maſter, or againſt him as Ambaſſadour, and that they ought to be in a readineſs for every thing; which they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe. In the mean time the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the other Princes beſought the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, to find out ſome way of accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but they made anſwer that they had expreſs Orders from his Holyneſs, to make the Ceremonies equal, that they had paſt their promiſe thereupon to the Count <hi>de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and that it could not be otherwiſe. Hereupon the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> proteſted to the Legates, that if they made ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Privileges of his Maſter, he would take the Pulpit and ſpeak in name of all the <hi>French,</hi> that he would complain to the whole Aſſembly of the injury that was done them, and that having laid open the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that that would cauſe in Chriſtendom, he would come down, take a Crucifix in his hand, and goe out of the Church crying <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordia,</hi> that he would perſwade the Fathers of the Council to follow him out of the Church, that they might not be Spectatours of ſo Scandalous a Schiſm; and that he was
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:99003:300"/>ſure of bringing over a great many to his Party. That Menace frightned the Legates, they doubted he might be in the humour to doe as he ſaid, at leaſt they were afraid to put it to the riſque. And therefore they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> that no proceſſion might be made on <hi>Sunday,</hi> nor Chapel held, till they had informed the Pope of all that had happened. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, on their part, made great noiſe, and declared that they were reſolved to proteſt, not againſt the Legates who followed their Commiſſion; not againſt the Catholick King who maintained his Rights as he thought beſt; not againſt the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> who obeyed his Maſter's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; not, in fine, againſt the Holy See, for which they had a great Veneration; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pius</hi> IV. who called himſelf Pope, and was not; adding that they would prove him to be no lawfull Pope, becauſe he had inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated himſelf into the Holy See by the way of Simony: And for proof of this they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced two Scedules or Notes for conſiderable Summs; one which Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> had from the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> for favouring the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cardinal of <hi>Medicis,</hi> which Scedule Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> had ſince ſent to the King of <hi>France;</hi> the other Scedule was under the Pope's own hand to the Cardinal of <hi>Naples;</hi> and though that laſt Writing was not in the hands of the <hi>French;</hi> yet it was a thing noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known, and paſt for a certain truth. Beſides the Proteſtation, the Preſident <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> had prepared a moſt bitter <hi>Latine</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, which was not ſpoken, though it was afterwards Printed. In that Speech, having
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:99003:301"/>aſſerted the Rights of Precedency of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> by a Long and Uninterrupted Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, he declared that he did not attribute the trouble that was given him, neither to the Council, nor to the Catholick King but to the Perſon of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. who ſow'd Seeds of Diſcord amongſt confederated Kings; and with damnable ingratitude forgot the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Holy See had to <hi>Pepin, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who had raiſed it to all its Grandure. He proteſted that he owned him not for the true Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſince all that was done in it came from <hi>Rome,</hi> ready concluded and determined, he could not look upon the Decrees of that Aſſembly, as of a General Council. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he commanded, in his Maſter's name, all <hi>French</hi> Prelates to retire, untill a lawfull and free Council ſhould be called. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and Harangue were not made; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at length means were found to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſome manner the Difference; and that was, the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> after much Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſented that untill he had received an anſwer from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Maſter, neither the one nor the other ſhould receive the Incenſe and the <hi>Pax.</hi> A great many were offended at this Agreement; and the Pope himſelf did not approve of it. However moſt of the Prelates would have been glad that that Debate had laſted much longer, becauſe they were in good hopes that it would have been a means of diſſolving the Council, of which they were ſufficiently weary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="521" facs="tcp:99003:301"/>We have been ſomewhat the longer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Hiſtory of this Difference, becauſe it was the Cauſe of the great Quarel that hath been betwixt two of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Crowns in Chriſtendom. And we were not willing to interrupt the Series of that Conteſt, by interweaving the other affairs of the Council, to which at preſent we return. The Count <hi>de Luna</hi> having made his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick entry into the Council,<note place="margin">The Count <hi>de Luna</hi> makes his entry into the Council. His Divine by his Speech of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the other Princes.</note> in the General Congregation held the one and twentieth of <hi>May;</hi> he ordered <hi>Pietro Fontidonio</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Divine to ſpeak in his name. This Divine ſpoke in a ſtrain that was very agreeable to the Party which ſtood up for the Intereſts of the Pope. For he told the Council that there was no way to deal with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants but by the Severity of Puniſhments. He made an Invective againſt Trimmers who were for indulging any thing in their favour: and to prove this, he inſtanced the happy Succeſs of the Severity which his Maſter had employed in ſuppreſſing of Hereſie. The Council made a very favourable anſwer to this Diſcourſe; but the Ambaſſadours took it very impatiently, looking upon that Harangue as an open Cenſure of all other Princes, who had not imitated the Conduct of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> They complained to the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> of the boldneſs of his Spokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who diſowned it, aſſuring them that he had ordered him to leave out that part of his Diſcourſe, and promiſing to reprove him for not following his Directions.</p>
                  <p>A few days after, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went to meet the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:99003:302"/>was upon his return from his Legation in <hi>France.</hi> He made ſome ſtay in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and laboured to compoſe the Affairs of Religion, which were in no very good condition there; for notwithſtanding all the care the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had uſed, the <hi>Huguenot</hi> Party grew very ſtrong; and ſeveral made open profeſſion of that Religion even in the Duke's Court. Theſe two Cardinals had their interview at <hi>Hoſtia</hi> in the <hi>Veroneſe</hi> the four and twentieth of <hi>May;</hi> where the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> uſed all his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to perſwade <hi>Lorrain</hi> to return to <hi>France,</hi> ſhewing him that the Intereſt of his Family required it, becauſe of the death of his two Brothers the Duke and Grand Prior. He dealt earneſtly with him alſo to employ his credit with the <hi>French</hi> Prelates, that they would deſiſt from preſſing that the Inſtitution of Biſhops and their Reſidence ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of Divine Right. But the Cardinal would not hear of it; he continued ſtedfaſt in his deſign of ſtaying at the Council; and as he ſaid, of having matters concluded according to truth and reaſon. Upon his return to <hi>Trent,</hi> he bragg'd much how he had reſiſted the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> but that was the laſt act of conſtancy and vigour that came from him; for after that time, he made ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and conſiderable a compliance, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the chief inſtrument which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> employed for ſhaking and baffling the vigour of others. However he ſeemed ſtill to retain a little ſtedfaſtneſs in a Conference that he had with Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> after his return from <hi>Hoſtia.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> to ſooth and flatter him, told him that he wiſhed he were
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:99003:302"/>at the helm of affairs, and that he had the ſame Authority as the Legates had, that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more the Pope deſired a Reformation, and would ſet about it; that none of the Articles which had been propoſed by the ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were deſired to be left out, but thoſe which related to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the Pope would have the honour of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelf. The Cardinal was not catcht in that trap, but made anſwer, that ſaving the reſpect which was due to the Holy See, what concerned the Reformation of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> might be very well propoſed in the Council. But he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not long in that ſtyle, for the Cardinal received Letters from the Queen, informing him that his preſence would be far more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in <hi>France</hi> than at <hi>Trent:</hi> ſhe told him that there was no more good to be expected from the Council for <hi>France;</hi> that all that could have been obtained from it, would onely have been in order to reunite the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants to the Church: but that that was a thing not to be hoped for now, ſince the peace with the <hi>Huguenots</hi> held good; and that therefore the Pope was to be contented. She wrote alſo to the Pope, that ſhe would order the <hi>French</hi> Prelates to concur in any thing that might tend to the ſpeedy Concluſion of the Council, and not to diſpute his Authority any more. From that time forward the Cardinal thought of nothing but of returning to <hi>France;</hi> he was troubled to underſtand, that the peace with the Proteſtants was like to hold, for he mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and feared the growth of the Party, not ſo much out of Zeal
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:99003:303"/>for Religion, as becauſe he knew that that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not be Eſtabliſhed but upon the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of his Family, by reaſon of the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable hatred that was betwixt the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Great men that were engaged in the intereſts of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. He conſidered with himſelf, that to ſupport him againſt a Party which was like to gather new ſtrength by a Peace, he ſtood in need of the favour of the Pope; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bent all his thoughts for the future, to incline him to eſpouſe his Intereſts by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be wholly at his devotion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A new Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour from <hi>France</hi> comes.</note>About the ſame time the Preſident <hi>de Birague</hi> the new <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour arrived, and was received in the Congregation of the ſecond of <hi>June:</hi> But becauſe in his Credentials he was not called Ambaſſadour, all the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of Princes, who commonly come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe of <hi>France</hi> did not appear, that they might not be obliged to take their places after him. <hi>Birague</hi> preſented to the Council a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the King, wherein he gave once more reaſons for the Peace which he had concluded with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> ſtill proteſting that it was done in proſpect of reclaiming to the Church thoſe that were gone aſtray, by a ſurer way than that of Arms: that farther, he expected, that they would aid and aſſiſt him in that deſign, by the Reformation which he had demanded, and ſtill did demand from the Council. <hi>Birague</hi>'s Harangue contained onely the ſame things ſomewhat more amplified: and ſeeing the Legates knew what <hi>Birague</hi> was to ſay before they had heard him in the Council, they were prepared to make an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:99003:303"/>to his Speech, by complements of condole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the King had been in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make Peace with the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> They farther added that they diſapproved not what he had done, exhorting him nevertheleſs, that ſo ſoon as his Kingdom were in Peace, he would endeavour all he could to cure the wound that Hereſie had made in his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This anſwer was communicated to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> before it was given; but he oppoſed it, objecting that the Council ought not to approve the Peace which the King had made with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> ſeeing it was ſo prejudicial to the Church; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to take time to anſwer. This advice was taken, and the Legates made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Birague,</hi> that the matters which he had propoſed were ſo weighty, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil deſired time to give an anſwer to them; but the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were extremely vexed with the Cardinal for this action. They were about to have written to the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; but becauſe <hi>Lanſac</hi> was ſpeedily to return, they gave it him in Commiſſion to make a report thereof to the King.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Congregations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for Examining matters touching the Sacrament of Orders; and the Prelates did not ſtick ſo cloſely to the point, but that many times they purpoſely flew out into digreſſions. In one of theſe Congregations the Biſhop of <hi>Nimes</hi> diſcourſed freely enough againſt <hi>Annats,</hi> and againſt ſeveral abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> amongſt the reſt, againſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Prieſts, who were admitted without examination or capacity. In another Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:99003:304"/>the Biſhop of <hi>Cadix</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhew'd the needleſneſs of Titulary Biſhops, whom he called <hi>figmenta humana,</hi> an invention of the Court <hi>of Rome,</hi> and what diſorders theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops without Biſhopricks cauſed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Diſcipline of the Church. But ſeeing all the abuſes introduced by Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority found inſtantly Protectors among the <hi>Italians,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Sarzana</hi> a <hi>Tuſcan</hi> roſe up and defended the Cauſe of thoſe Titular Biſhops. Another <hi>Spaniard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lugo</hi> in <hi>Gallicia</hi> ſpoke againſt Diſpenſations, and affirmed, that it was not neceſſary to ſet Bounds to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to declare the invalidity of thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, or rather that it is impoſſible to give Diſpenſations about moſt things that are ſo freely diſpenſed with. About this time <hi>Angelo Maſſarelo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tileſio</hi> in <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> Clark of the Council, being grievouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Stone, reſolved to be cut of it, and deſiſted from officiating in Perſon as Clark: and this removed one of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that have been mentioned; which was, that the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> having made great inſtances that he ſhould be aſſigned an Aſſiſtant for collecting the Acts, becauſe they queſtioned his fidelity; they gave him for a Subſtitute another <hi>Italian,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Campagna</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The firſt buſineſs that he did as Clark, was to read the anſwer which was to be given to <hi>Birague,</hi> of which the Legates had preſented a Draught to the Council. It was long and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, and it did not therein appear whether the Fathers commended or blamed the action
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:99003:304"/>of the King of <hi>France</hi> in making Peace with the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> The Prelates gave their Votes, and the dark and ambiguous ſtrain that it was framed in, was cauſe of diverſity of opinions. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> approved it not, which was a ſurpriſing matter, becauſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Morone</hi> having ſhew'd it him, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been ſatisfied therewith. In ſine, the matter was referred to the Legates, and the two Cardinals <hi>Madruccio</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with power to frame that anſwer, as they ſhould judge moſt convenient.</p>

                     <hi>June</hi> the eleventh, the Legates had a ſolemn conſultation for finding out Expedients to ſettle the differences about the queſtion of the Divine Right of the Inſtitution of Biſhops. This gave the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was preſent at the Conſultation, occaſion to ſpeak of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope, a queſtion that depends naturally on that of the Inſtitution of Biſhops. He touched by the bye the opinion of the <hi>French,</hi> that the Pope is Inferiour to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, declaring that it was not his deſire that the Council ſhould Pronounce in favour of that opinion; but withall, he wiſhed that they would not decide any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

A <hi>French</hi> Prelate hereupon gave the Legates advice not to call the Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto</hi> any more to Conſultations with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> becauſe the Cardinal was informed that the Archbiſhop ſpoke ill of him on all occaſions, and ſpared not to call him a man full of Venome. Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> gave no heed to that advice; but anſwered that he had orders from the Pope to doe nothing without the Archbiſhop, that he had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of forty Votes, and that therefore he muſt not be diſobliged. The Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> was ſufficiently vexed both with Cardinal <hi>Morone,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto;</hi> but the deſign he had of getting into the Pope's favour obliged him to diſſemble.</p>
                  <p>Preſident <hi>Birague</hi> having ſtayed for the Councils Anſwer as long as became his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, went to wait on the Emperour at <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck,</hi> according as he was enjoined by his Commiſſion. And his chief buſineſs was to confer with the Emperour about the means of transferring the Council unto a place where it might enjoy full liberty. The Queen of <hi>France</hi> had written of that to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who diſliked the propoſition; but he wrote to the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> his Ambaſſadour, that according to the Inſtructions which he had given him, he ſhould preſs the revocation of the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis,</hi> for ſetting the Council at liberty.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de Luna</hi> having declared his Commiſſion to the Legates, they anſwered that the Clauſe had paſt with conſent of the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:99003:305"/>Council, and that it could not be revoked. At the ſame time the Pope was earneſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited at <hi>Rome,</hi> to diſpenſe with that Clauſe, and, at length, to caſe himſelf of the trouble that was given him upon that account; he wrote to Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> that they ſhould Superſede the execution of it; but <hi>Morone,</hi> without conſulting his Collegues, anſwered plainly, that he could not, and that he had rather his Holineſs would recall them. In the Congregation of the fifteenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Prelates pitcht upon the fifteenth of <hi>July</hi> for the day of the next Seſſion, and in the Congregation next day after,<note place="margin">Another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Lainez</hi> in favour of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Lainez</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Jeſuits ſpeaking in his turn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to cenſure and refute all that had been ſaid by others againſt the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And he did it ſo vehemently and with ſo much zeal, as if he had been treating of matters whereupon the Salvation of mankind depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He made an Apology for Diſpenſations, <hi>Annats,</hi> the Wealth of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for every thing that others called Abuſes. He proved the Pope's Superiority over a Council, and advanced his Authority not onely over Biſhops, but the whole Church, as far as could be imagined, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he had done in his former Harangue. The <hi>French</hi> were diſguſted at this diſcourſe, nor were the <hi>Spaniards</hi> better ſatisfied: they were perſwaded that the Legates had choſen him as their mouth to ſpeak their thoughts; for it was obſerved that they affected to ſhow a particular reſpect for him. When he ſpoke they made him come out of his place, and ſit in the middle of the Aſſembly, whereas
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:99003:306"/>the other Generals ſpoke ſtanding, and kept themſelves in their own places. <hi>Lainez</hi> was never tedious, though he had taken up the whole time of Congregations; but the others were never ſhort enough. This Jeſuit ſent his excuſes to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Prelates, pretending that he had not the leaſt deſign of offending them; but that he onely aimed at the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Doctors, whoſe opinions were not agreeable to the ſentiment of the Church. This excuſe gave a new offence to the <hi>French,</hi> and particularly to the Divines. <hi>John de Verdun</hi> a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk, deſired leave from the Cardinal to refute <hi>Lainez,</hi> nay even the <hi>Cordelier Hugonis,</hi> though bought by the Pope's Penſion, offered himſelf to prove, that the propoſition which <hi>Lainez</hi> had aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>that the Tribunal of the Pope is the ſame as that of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is an Impious and Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Propoſition. But the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who had his private views and intereſts, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heat of their Zeal. All theſe Difficulties and Janglings aroſe upon the Points of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the Inſtitution of Biſhops being of Divine Right; and therefore the Legates to ſtop up the Spring of the Diviſions, laboured inceſſantly to form a Decree concerning theſe matters, which by its Ambiguity and by clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing at all, might give all content. They did the Jobb, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> was ſatisfied with it; but the Pope's Divines, and Penſionary Prelates who outdid the Legates in the matter of Zeal for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> found a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand difficulties in it. The draught of it was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they Judged, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:99003:306"/>of <hi>Trent</hi> had done, that the Authority of the Pope over Biſhops was not raiſed high enough; inſomuch that the diligence and pains of the Legates had no ſucceſs at this time. About this time the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was in no little perplexity, upon occaſion of <hi>Maximilian</hi> lately Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had no great kindneſs for that Court. He reſolved to ſend Ambaſſadours to the Pope, to acquaint him with his Election, but he would not doe it in the form that ſome of his Predeceſſours had done, who had promiſed and ſworn to the Pope whatever he pleaſed. He therefore deſired to know what terms he ſhould make uſe of. The matter was taken into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and the Cardinals concluded, that he ought to demand Confirmation from the Pope, and promiſe him all obedience, as they who had gone before him had done. He refuſed it, declaring that his Ambaſſadour ſhould promiſe no more in his name, but all devotion, reverence and complaiſance for his Holineſs, and the Holy See. There were great Negotiations about this affair; and at length it ended ſo, as that the Ambaſſadour neither demanded Confirmation, nor promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Obedience; and yet the Pope in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer gave the Confirmation which was not required of him, and accepted the Obedience that was not offered. This was a Comedy that diverted no body, neither the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nor his Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>In the Congregation of the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>June,</hi> the anſwer which was to be given to Preſident <hi>Birague</hi> was read, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not there, it was ſent to him in
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:99003:307"/>writing. About the ſame time, the Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Adamo Fumamo</hi> Aſſiſtant to the Biſhop of <hi>Tileſio,</hi> who continued ſtill ill of the Stone, in the Office of Clark of the Council. The following Congregations were ſpent in cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, about thoſe queſtions ſo often canvas'd concerning Reſidence, and the Inſtitution of Biſhops. And indeed, it was all the talk in private Converſations; but the Biſhops began at length to be weary of it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made a great deal to doe about it, but moſt of the reſt being cloy'd with ſuch debates, were of opinion, that theſe Points ſhould be laid aſide. This opinion prevailed at length, but not without great oppoſition. There were likewiſe great diſputes about a certain Article of Reformation, by which the more ſevere ſort would have had a Decree to tie up the hands of thoſe who had the right of Nomination to Biſhopricks, and oblige them to chuſe always the worthieſt. The Ambaſſadours of Kings, and the Pope's Party oppoſed this, alledging, that it was too ſevere an impoſition upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it was ſufficient that they conferred not Biſhopricks but upon deſerving perſons, without obliging them to chuſe always the worthieſt; and that it was not Juſt to deprive the Pope, and Kings of the Power of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their faithfull Servants; that it was enough that they did not abuſe the Power which the Council left them, and never put into Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks but deſerving men. They farther alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that the Overture that was propoſed, was abſolutely impracticable: for theſe Reformers deſired, that when a Biſhoprick fell to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, the Metropolitan ſhould acquaint the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:99003:307"/>Chapter with the name of him that was No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated; that his name ſhould be publiſhed in all the Pariſh Churches of the Town, and affixt on the Doors; and that afterward, the Metropolitan ſhould goe to the Epiſcopal Town, and make a very ſtrict inquiry into the Learning, Life, and Manners of him that had been Nominated, and that all who had any thing to object might be heard. <hi>Lainez</hi> the Jeſuit among others repreſented, that this method would be found ſo difficult and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing, that it would be impoſſible to reduce it into practice. The Council found out an Expedient for this affair, as they did for all others, which we ſhall ſpeak of hereafter. The Legates ſuffered alſo ſome Propoſitions to be made for the Reformation of the Cardinals; for the Pope being informed of all that was talkt of at <hi>Trent,</hi> and in the Courts of Princes, thought it was his policy and intereſt not to appear averſe from that Reformation. He brought it therefore under deliberation both at <hi>Trent</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould be made at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the Council. The Legates and Cardinals who were preſent, aſwell as thoſe who aſpired to a Hat, brought matters ſo about, that this point was not medled with: ſo that it went no farther, and was no ſo much as propoſed. The Pope had alſo ſome thoughts of having Biſhops diſcharged from medling in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of worldly affairs; but Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> repreſented to him, that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>France,</hi> and of other Countries would thereby ſuſtain great prejudice, becauſe they were employed in all the Offices of State.
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:99003:308"/>And thus all the Propoſitions of Reformation were ſtifled in the birth. The Emperour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at this Conduct, and loſing all hopes of procuring any benefit from the Council,<note place="margin">The Emperour loſes all hopes of obtaining any good of the Council, and leaves <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck.</hi>
                     </note> left <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and at parting wrote to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that expecting no good from that Aſſembly, he thought it better to ſuffer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Calamities, than to occaſion greater, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Remedies that would not be taken. And now we have the <hi>Germans,</hi> aſwell as the <hi>French,</hi> overcome and diſheartned. There were none now but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſtood their ground a little; for the Emperour wrote to his Ambaſſadours, that they ſhould urge no more the Deciſion of the queſtion about the Power of the Pope, becauſe he well foreſaw, that to ſpeak of it would be the way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it; and that muſt be avoided, for fear of alienating more and more the minds of the <hi>German</hi> Proteſtants. The Ambaſſadours acquainted the Legates with the Emperour's intentions; and that came in very pat to confirm the opinion of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was clearly of the mind, that they ſhould ſpeak no more of the Inſtitution of Biſhops, and of the Authority of the Pope.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates about the Decrees of the Reſidence and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops. And the laſt Point is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid aſide.</note>The Legates, at length, that they might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to put an end to theſe long Debates, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to hold private Aſſemblies, into which all the moſt conſiderable Members of the Council ſhould be admitted, to the end that matters being adjuſted and reſolved upon by the leading men, they might be carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe and difficulty in the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. In theſe Aſſemblies the Legates propoſed the Decrees that were framed for
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:99003:308"/>the Reformation of Abuſes. The firſt ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> ſhould examine thoſe who were nominated to Biſhopricks, that ſo none but the more deſerving ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the Ambaſſadours ſtarted Objections again, grounded on the Intereſts of Princes from whom the Right of Nomination to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks was taken, by giving Power to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans</hi> to thwart theſe Nominations under Pretext of the unworthineſs of thoſe who were nominated. After much Conteſt, it was agreed that that Article ſhould be left for the following Seſſion. The like was done with the laſt Article which contained a Confeſſion of Faith, and the Form of an Oath. In that Oath were contained all the Doctrines and Articles of Faith, which diſtinguiſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Belief from that of the Proteſtants; ſuch as are the Superiority of the Pope, the Authority of Councils, the Truth of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Number of Seven Sacraments, the Real Preſence, Tranſubſtantiation, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs. It was not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that all who ſhould be received into Eccleſiaſtick Dignities ſhould ſwear that they believed all thoſe things, but likewiſe that Princes ſhould admit of no man to any Office whatſoever, till firſt they took that Oath, and ſwore to that Confeſſion. Having reſolved to lay that Article aſide till another time, they framed the Decree about Reſidence, leaving out all that might diſpleaſe thoſe who held it to be of Divine Right, and the others who affirmed it onely of Poſitive Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion did the Pope great Service. He had
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:99003:309"/>not long before received a very obliging Letter from him; and the Pope had invited him to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might confer with him, which the Cardinal had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner promiſed to doe. But he durſt not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely declare himſelf, before he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what the Court of <hi>France</hi> thought of that Journey. He did therefore all he could to diſpatch buſineſs, that ſo the next Seſſion might be held on the prefixed day; and that the Council proceeding apace, he might make his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſee a ſpeedy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Council, and then return to <hi>France.</hi> This being his aim, he drove at Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and was the Cauſe of ſtiffing a great Proceſs, which was occaſioned by a matter of very ſmall importance. And that was in relation to the Functions of the Inferiour Orders from the Deacon even to the Porter, about which the Divines kept a great Clutter. The Cuſtome had been for a long time diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, of having conſecrated Perſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Functions of theſe Lower Orders, as ſhutting Doors, lighting Candles, ringing Bells, and even Reading; theſe Offices being diſcharged by Laicks Now the Council thought it neceſſary to reſtore the Order, and to cauſe thoſe Functions to be performed by Conſecrated Perſons according to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifical: and that with deſign to ſilence <hi>Libertines,</hi> who maintained that theſe Offices were not Sacraments. But when the Biſhops were about to come to a Concluſion, and to frame the Decree, they were ſtopt by a difficulty, which is obvious to any man; for they who were not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:99003:309"/>that theſe Functions ſhould be reſtored to thoſe who had received Orders, asked what Neceſſity there was of a Spiritual Character, for performing of Actions merely Corporeal, as ſhutting of Doors and ringing of Bells. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> gave his opinion that that matter ſhould be left to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Biſhops; which prevailed. All were now for condeſcending that they might come to an end: Nevertheleſs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> held out ſtill, and perſiſted to have Reſidence declared to be of Divine Right, as well as the Inſtitution of Biſhops. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> brought over ſeveral, but a great many reſiſted his Solicitations. On the other hand the Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto</hi> and his Adherents, who were afraid of the leaſt ſhadow that might entrench upon the Authority of the Pope, would not conſent to the Decree, that the Legates had drawn up concerning Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; becauſe it ſaid, <hi>that all who have care of Souls; are obliged by the Command of God to look to their Flocks.</hi> They ſaid, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to look to their Flocks without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. If one be obliged to look to his Flock by the Command of God, he is by Conſequence obliged by the Command of God to reſide, and ſo Reſidence muſt be of Divine Right. Nor would they approve of the ſixth Canon, which faith that the Hierarchy hath been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Divine Ordinance. They were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that it might from thence be concluded, that all the Orders of that Hierarchy are of Divine and not Papal Inſtitution. They ſaid, that by that means Epiſcopacy was declared to be of Divine Right. Theſe Minutes had
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:99003:310"/>been an hundred times over conſulted at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Legates approved of them, ſince they had framed them; the Pope's Canoniſts and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines were very well ſatisfied with them; but all that was nothing, they would needs be more zealous for the Pope, than the Pope was for himſelf. Nevertheleſs in ſpight of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that Archbiſhop on the one hand, and of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Segovia</hi> on the other, the Aſſembly went on, and concluded that the Decrees muſt paſs in that form. And now the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations being ended, and the Decrees fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the General Congregations were begun again the ninth of <hi>July,</hi> for reading and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Decrees. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not yield yet. They made a noiſe in the Congregation and ſaid that they were abus'd, ſince that now after ſo long delaying to form the Chapter of the Inſtitution of Biſhops; there was no notice at all taken of it. They renewed their inſtances to have it declared to be of Divine Right, and made the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Demands about the Article of Reſidence: But at length the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> daſhed their Conſtancy; for he called them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeveral times at his houſe, and after many Skirmiſhes he obtained of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Segovia</hi> and the reſt of the moſt forward Prelates, that they would be ſatisfied to deliver their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without Paſſion and inſiſting in their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. And ſo on the fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> which was the Eve of the Seſſion, the Legates held the laſt General Congregation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a hundred fourſcore and twelve gave their
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:99003:310"/>Vote for holding the Seſſion next day, and onely twenty eight were againſt it. The Preſidents obliged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be ſilent, promiſing the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> that ſo ſoon as they had defined the Power of the Pope, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it was done by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> they ſhould make no more Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to declare the Inſtitution of Biſhops to be of Divine Right.</p>

The matter of Doctrine was digeſted into four Chapters, and eight Canons with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s. In them the Council declared, that Orders are a Sacrament; that there is a viſible Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the Goſpel, for offering up of the very body and very bloud of our Lord; that there are greater and leſſer Orders, by which one mounts as by ſteps to a greater Order, which is that of Prieſthood; that Orders do imprint a Character, and confer the Holy Ghoſt; that Unction is neceſſary in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the Hierarchy is of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; that Biſhops are ſuperiour to Prieſts; that the Conſent either of the People, or of the Magiſtrate, is not neceſſary to render valid the Ordination of Prieſts and Biſhops; and that Biſhops made and promoted by the Pope are true Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>After that, they read eighteen Chapters of Reformation: the firſt concerned Reſidence, which had cauſed ſo much Debate. That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree declares that every Paſtor is obliged by the Command of God to look to, and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:99003:311"/>feed his Flock. It prohibits long abſence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Penalties, but it makes no reckoning of an abſence that does not laſt above three Months. It ſomewhat aggravates the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were impoſed in the ſixth Seſſion of the firſt Convocation of the Council, which was held under <hi>Paul</hi> III. and to ſay the truth, it is not eaſie to judge of what advantage this new Decree is for Reſidence, ſince it adds little or nothing to the former. Nay more, a Clauſe was inſerted into this, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it altogether uſeleſs, <hi>unleſs the Service and Benefit of the Church, or State require it;</hi> for what Biſhop is there who neglects Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that will not ſay that he deſigns the good of the Church or State? The reſt of the Chapters of this Decree contain nothing that is conſiderable: onely ſome regulations about the Collation of Orders, and the Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Orders, that no undeſerving Perſon be received into them, and that thoſe who are received, doe their Duty. The laſt appoints Seminaries for breeding of thoſe who are deſign'd to the Prieſthood in every Dioceſs. Matters were carried on very calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe all the Prelates were prevailed with to keep ſilence. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a Quarrel with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for that, and complained highly of him, that he had abandoned them in the Point of Reſidence, after that he had many times promiſed them to beſtir himſelf vigorouſly for having it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be of Divine Right; but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates could not ſufficiently commend him.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> was in great expectation of this Seſſion, which had been the buſineſs of ten
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:99003:311"/>whole Months, and which was more, of two or three hundred Prelates and Divines. Never were People more ſurpriſed, than when they ſaw the little effects of ſo much pains; for they found nothing in the Decrees, but what a ſingle man of ſenſe might have eaſily gone through within a few weeks: and that rejoiced the Proteſtants; who pickt matter enough for their Sermons out of the Contradictions, and weak paſſages that they found in thoſe Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

And he failed not to expoſe to the Eyes of his People the Debates and Claſhings of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which he charged upon them as a great Scandal. He wrote of them alſo to the Proteſtant Miniſters on all hands, becauſe being near to <hi>Trent,</hi> he was able to inform thoſe who lived at a greater Diſtance.

At the ſame time that the Decrees about Marriage were framing, the Legates ſumm'd up the Articles which related to Reformation, and got the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to conſent, that they ſhould ſet about the compiling of thoſe alſo which concerned the Reformation of Princes; for it was their Intention to diſpatch all that remained in one Seſſion more. But this deſign was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> did not think that that ſuted with the Intereſts of his Maſter, or the good of Chriſtendom. He told them that it was not convenient to precipitate in Affairs, but that time ſhould be taken to work upon the Proteſtants, that they might be brought to come and ſubmit to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: that his Holineſs, indeed, had had the goodneſs to ſend <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s to them; but that they ought not to reſt there, ſeeing it was to no purpoſe to have called a Council, if the <hi>Lutherans</hi> received not its Decrees; in a word, that they ought to be invited to come, no more in name of the Pope for whom they had an Averſion, but in name of the Council, which was not ſo hatefull to them. He therefore demanded that the Divines might
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:99003:312"/>be heard publickly about the matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and what other Points remained to be handled; and that they ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſame manner, and with as much leiſure, as the reſt had been before. The Pope whom one could not diſoblige more, than by hindring the Concluſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, complained to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Conduct of the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> and wrote about it to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf. He took it extremely ill that he ſhould have mentioned the inviting of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants again, conſidering with what an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Contempt they had received the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and Civilities that had been already offered them. Nor was he at all ſatisfied that the Ambaſſadour ſhould have attempted to Preſcribe to the Legates the manner how they ought to handle matters; but the thing that moſt of all vexed him, was the deſign of retarding the Concluſion of the Council, to which all theſe Propoſitions tended. But for all the Chafe the Pope was in, the Count beſtirred himſelf to make a Party at <hi>Trent;</hi> for there were a great many of the mind that the Controverſies which the Legates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to huddle up and decide without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination were of as much or more importance, than thoſe which had coſt ſo much labour and pains. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether now for the ways of quickeſt Diſpatch; and therefore he concurred in opinion with the Legates, eſpecially ſince he formed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of going to <hi>Rome</hi> as the Pope had invited him. He had received Letters from <hi>France,</hi> where in he was adviſed to comply with the Pope's
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:99003:313"/>deſire, and give him that ſatisfaction. So that being ready for his Journey, he onely expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſitting of the next Seſſion that he might be gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They ſet about forming the Decrees and Canons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Matter of Marriage, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next Seſſion.</note>In the Congregation of the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>July,</hi> the Legates produced the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons concerning the matter of Marriage, much in the ſame form as they ſtand in at preſent. There was no Difficulty about Marriage, and the ſingle life of Prieſts. The Emperour, King of <hi>France,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had, indeed, deſired that Prieſts might be allowed to marry; but when the Biſhop of the five Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Emperour's Ambaſſadour, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> moved the Council to make ſome more reflexion upon that Point, they were ſcarcely heard. Nevertheleſs the Pope had but very lately before given freſh Promiſes to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to give him ſatisfaction as to that matter; becauſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Countrey had made an Inſurrection that they might obtain from their Prince the Reſtitution of the Cup, and Permiſſion for married men to Preach. The greateſt Debates were about Clandeſtine Marriages. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours demanded that they ſhould be declared null. An hundred and thirty fix Votes were for it, fifty ſix oppoſed it, and ten would not declare for either ſide. At length the Prelates agreed to Reform the Canon in the manner as now it goes, that is, that Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriages are true Marriages, and real Sacraments, whilſt the Church does not annull them; that the Church hath always deteſted them, and for the future declares, that all who are Married or Betrothed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:99003:313"/>the preſence of two or three Witneſſes at leaſt, are incapable of contracting, and that by Conſequence the Marriage ſhall be null. In the ſame Congregation the Canons and <hi>Anathema</hi>'s were read; the fifth of which Canons pronounces <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe who maintain the Divorces which are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Code of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to be lawfull; that is to ſay, ſuch as are made upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Hereſie, and refuſal of Cohabitation. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> got this Canon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to give a blow to the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> who teach that the refuſal of Cohabitation is a lawfull reaſon for a man to divorce from his Wife. The ſeventh Canon condemns thoſe who aſſert, that Adultery diſſolves Marriage. At firſt it was propoſed without <hi>Anathema,</hi> out of ſome reſpect that ſtill remained for the opinion of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers; but notwithſtanding that Conſideration, it was thought fit to add the <hi>Anathema.</hi> In the following Congregations there was much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the Obſtacles of contracting Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which ſpring from the Prohibition of marrying within certain remote Degrees, not onely of natural, but ſpiritual kindred, ſuch as Goſſipſhips, or the Relations betwixt God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers. It was repreſented that in ſome places twenty Godfathers and as many Godmothers were ſometimes invited, and that it many times happens that ſuch not knowing one another for Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, marry together without Diſpenſation, and run into the Guilt of Sin. Others ſaid upon occaſion of the Prohibition of Marriage within remote Degrees, that People have not
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:99003:314"/>always by them Books of Genealogy, ſo that having forgot their diſtant Kindred, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within the Degrees, and engage themſelves into bonds, which by the Laws of the Church, are unlawfull. They therefore demanded that all theſe Prohibitions might be aboliſhed, or at leaſt that Biſhops might have Power to diſpenſe with them, that ſo People might not be put to the trouble of writing or ſending to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> about matters of ſo ſmall importance. The Council had no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe Remonſtrances, onely prohibited the multiplying of Godfathers and Godmothers. But the Sticklers for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> would not yield an Inch in Relation to Prohibited Degrees, leſt ſuch Condeſcenſion might be looked upon by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as a gaining of the Cauſe, and might diminiſh the Revenues of the Pope. And, indeed, it may be ſaid that they made the Yoke of Diſpenſations heavier, for it was ordained that no more Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be granted in Prohibited Degrees, how remote ſoever they might be, unleſs very preſſing reaſons required the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Legates propoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Princes. The Ambaſſadours oppoſe it.</note>This being done the Legates were obliged to propoſe the Articles of Reformation. They offered thirty eight of them, which related both to the Abuſes committed by Princes in invading the Rights of the Church, and the ſeveral Abuſes that were crept into the Clergy. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who made it all his buſineſs to pleaſe the Pope, and haſten the Concluſion of the Council, adviſed the Legates to cut off the moſt part of theſe Articles, and eſpecially thoſe that might meet with greateſt Difficulty. This Overture ſurpriſed the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:99003:314"/>of <hi>Warmia;</hi> he could not conceive what was become of that great Zeal which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in the beginning preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Reformation. The Cardinal who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Surpriſe, told him, that he ought not to look upon his Condeſcenſion as ſtrange, that he ſtill retained the ſame Zeal, and the ſame Intentions; but that he had learnt by Experience, that nothing was to be expected from the Council concerning Reformation. Theſe Articles were communicated to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Princes, and all of them made their ſeveral additions and obſervations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intereſts of the Maſters. Moſt of the Ambaſſadours obſervations tended to the curbing of the Pope's Authority, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to the Attempts upon the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; others drove at the leſſening the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Biſhops, and oppoſing the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Clergy upon the Civil Juriſdiction. The obſervations of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were the higheſt of all; for they demanded that the number of Cardinals ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed twenty four; that the Nephews of the Pope in being, or of a Cardinal ſhould not be promoted to a Hat; that Cardinals ſhould not poſſeſs Biſhopricks; that all Pretexts of holding ſeveral Benefices ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; that Criminal Cauſes of Biſhops ſhould not be judged out of the Kingdom; that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould have Power to abſolve in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; that Preventions, Reſignations in favour, Mandates or <hi>Mandamus</hi>'s, Reverſions, and all other unlawfull ways of obtaining Benefices ſhould be aboliſhed; that Churchmen ſhould meddle no more in Secular Affairs; and that
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:99003:315"/>nothing ſhould be done to the prejudice of the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> and Liberties of the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church. But all the Ambaſſadours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to demand a forbearance of handling the Articles of the Reformation of Princes untill another Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Legates having gathered together all theſe obſervations aſſembled themſelves with the two Cardinals <hi>Madruccio</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to conſult what they ſhould doe about them. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ſtill of opinion that all ſuch Articles as might occaſion Debate ſhould be left out, and particularly ſuch as were like to be oppoſed by the Ambaſſadours. The Legates ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> the Articles which they had propoſed to the Council, with the Obſervations of the Ambaſſadours: and whilſt they waited for an anſwer, on the Eleventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they began the Congregations for finiſhing and completing the Canons of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.<note place="margin">The matter of Marriage is pitcht upon.</note> In theſe Conferences freſh Debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe about Clandeſtine Marriages. The <hi>French</hi> demanded that all Marriages of Children in the Family contracted without the Conſent of their Parents ſhould be declared null. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſeconded that Demand, and ſhew'd the Juſtice of it by many reaſons, and Authorities. But the Archbiſhop of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranto,</hi> who was always oppoſite to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> withſtood it, alledging that it was to give Lay-men Power over Sacraments though moſt of thoſe who ſpoke in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were of opinion that the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be laid aſide. About the end of the Congregation the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Venice</hi> came in, and repreſented that the Kingdoms of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi>
                     <pb n="549" facs="tcp:99003:315"/>and <hi>Candia,</hi> with the Iſlands of <hi>Zante, Corfeu</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia</hi> were under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Republick, and that it was the Cuſtome of the People of thoſe Countries who were of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, to repudiate their Wives when they were guilty of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; they therefore prayed the Council ſo to frame their Decree, that it might do no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Cuſtome of thoſe People. In the following Congregation the Demand of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was taken into Conſideration; and many thought it reaſonable, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> had not been cited, and that it was not juſt to condemn People without being heard. Others thought that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were ſufficiently cited by the Publication and General Convocation of the Council. But the Party that favoured the <hi>Venetians</hi> Demand grew ſtronger by the Conjunction of thoſe who could not digeſt the Anathematiſing of the opinion, That Adultery diſſolves a former, and gives the innocent party Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a new Marriage, becauſe it had been the opinion of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Council therefore found out a mean, they did not pronounce <hi>Anathema</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who ſay, that Adultery diſſolves Marriage; but againſt thoſe who ſay that the Church errs in affirming, That Adultery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves not Marriage. This was found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be a pretty pleaſant diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The Council then returned to the Demand of the <hi>French</hi> about Clandeſtine Marriages, and this head was as warmly diſputed, as if nothing had been as yet ſaid to it. Cardinal <hi>Madruccio,</hi> and two Legates the Cardinals of
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:99003:316"/>
                     <hi>Warmia</hi> and <hi>Simoneta</hi> held that they could not be annulled, and ſeemed as if they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to oppoſe any reſolution to the contrary. <hi>Lainez</hi> General of the Jeſuits ſcattered abroad Copies of a Writing that maintained the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of theſe Clandeſtine Marriages, and proved that they could not be annulled: This Debate took up ſeveral Congregations; and to encreaſe the Difficulty, the Biſhop of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> maintained that it was a matter of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, becauſe the queſtion was about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Clandeſtine Marriages, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Sacraments: and that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church was likewiſe concerned in it, to wit, whether ſhe have Power to reſcind Marriages, and annull a Sacrament, and that by Conſequence that Point could not be handled amongſt the Chapters of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His deſign was to put the <hi>French</hi> to new ſtraits, becauſe, as it hath been obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, many more Votes are required for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Decree about Doctrine, than making a Deciſion concerning Reformation. Others oppoſed this opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Sulmona</hi> and that not without Paſſion, ſaying that the Power of the Church ought never to be brought into queſtion; but that it ought always to be ſuppoſed; and that opinion carried it, ſo that it was concluded that that Chapter ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main amongſt the Articles of Reformation. Opinions varying, and each Party maintaining their Sentiments with heats, <hi>Francis de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caire</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mets</hi> had the honour of finding a form of a Decree, which ſatisfied the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties: And that was it which is in force at preſent. All were almoſt content with it,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:99003:316"/>becauſe it is ambiguous, and every one finds his Sentiment therein; for it Anathematiſes thoſe who ſay, that Clandeſtine Marriages are not true Sacraments; and yet it prohibits ſuch, affirming that the Church hath always deteſted them. An hundred thirty and five Votes were for the opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Mets,</hi> and fifty ſix againſt it.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Council was in ſome trouble, by reaſon that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he had a deſign of ſetling the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> This news allarmed all the Prelates of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> alſo, who concluded that if the Inquiſition were once eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it would likewiſe be introduced into <hi>Naples.</hi> The City of <hi>Milan</hi> ſent Deputies to the Pope, to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Council for preventing of that blow. The Envoys declared, that many of the chief Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were ready to leave the Countrey; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew very well that the Deſign of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition is not always the Preſervation of the Faith; but that its chief Aim is to drain thoſe that are rich, and hath no other proſpect for moſt part but worldly advantage. This put the Council to ſome trouble, becauſe of the great number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concerned. The Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> finding ſo great oppoſition, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſome Information, that the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> hatched a deſign of doeing what the People of the Low Countries had done, who turned Proteſtants to avoid the Inquiſition, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="552" facs="tcp:99003:317"/>In the mean time, the Pope to whom the Obſervations, and Additions which the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours had made as to the thirty eight Articles of Reformation propoſed by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, were ſent, found them not at all to his mind. He perceived amongſt them Demands that were grievous both to himſelf and his Court, and that made him more ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that a Period might be put to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which obliged him to write to his <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>'s that reſided in the Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that they would preſs the Princes to aſſiſt him in bringing of it to a Concluſion. He wrote alſo to the Legates that by any means they ſhould make an end, and that in order thereunto they ſhould grant every thing that they could not refuſe. But the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> ſtood always in the way, and uſed endeavours to croſs that ſpeedy Concluſion; he backt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> who were ſcandalized that Aſſemblies were ſo often kept at the Houſes of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, where none were admitted but Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto,</hi> and ſome Favorites: but that hindered not the Legates from keeping ſuch Aſſemblies ſtill. Of the thirty eight articles of Reformation, they had already left out ſix, at the deſire of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours; and moreover, the Emperour's Ambaſſadours by new Orders from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and being ſeconded by the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> made freſh inſtances, that the Reformation of Princes ſhould not be propoſed that Seſſion, which at length was granted; ſo that the Articles were reduced to twenty one. And Cardinal <hi>Simoneta</hi> and the Pope's Adherents took all the pains they could to ſhape them
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:99003:317"/>into ſuch a form as might not in the leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the Authority of the Pope, and yet give ſome ſatisfaction to thoſe who ſo ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently demanded Reformation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Legates are willing to ſatisfie the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Princes: but that cauſes great noiſe.</note>The chief Deſign of the Legates was to pleaſe the Biſhops, becauſe without them there was no concluding of the Council. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Aim of the Biſhops, was to enlarge their Power, and for accompliſhing of that deſign they demanded three things.
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, that they ſhould have the abſolute Collation of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices that had Cure of Souls, that ſo the Curats might depend on them.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, that the Council would aboliſh all the Exemptions of Chapters, of privileged Churches, and of Monks or Regulars, who by certain Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges obtained from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had found a way to decline the Power of their Biſhops:</item>
                        <item>And thirdly, that all thoſe hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be removed, which Princes and Secular Magiſtrates bring to Eccleſiaſtick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, calling that an invaſion of Princes, when they ſtrive what they can to hinder the Clergy from challenging and taking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Trials of civil Cauſes, and temporal Juriſdiction.</item>
                     </list> The Legates were very well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſatisfie the Biſhops as to the third Point of their Demand, becauſe none but Princes muſt pay for that, whoſe intereſt they did not at all conſider. And therefore in the Articles which they propoſed, they failed not to inſert every thing that could contribute to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving of the Juriſdiction of Biſhops to the ſame State that the Invaſions of the Clergy had formerly brought it to. And upon theſe three heads chiefly the Articles of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:99003:318"/>run, for the ſatisfaction of the Biſhops. But as to the ſecond Point which concerns the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions of the Regulars or Monks, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates had no mind to comply too much with the Biſhops, becauſe that could not be done without Diminution of the Authority and Profits of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which all the Monks hold immediately: And if the Biſhops made inſtances on their ſide for obtaining that Demand, the Generals of Orders who were preſent in the Council, on the other hand, vehemently oppoſed it. The Legates had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a particular Congregation for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Monks, and in that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers good Regulations were made, to which the Generals of Orders had ſubmitted, becauſe that Monks are pretty well ſatisfied, that the Rules to which they are oblig'd ſhould be ſevere and hard, that being the thing that appears outwardly to the World, and which gains them a great Reputation of Sanctity and Auſterity. But, after all, ſince they are the Maſters of the Monaſteries within doors, and of the manner how theſe Rules are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the Severity of Orders incommodes them no more than they pleaſe themſelves. But for the matter of Exemptions, they would by no means have that medled with. They liked it much better to depend on a Maſter that lived at a diſtance, who could not watch over their Conduct, than on a Biſhop who would always have his Eyes upon them. Nevertheleſs the reaſon that they alledged for their refuſal was the remiſneſs and relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Biſhops allowed themſelves in their Conduct and Converſation, and franckly ſaid,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:99003:318"/>that when Prelates were Maſters of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Biſhops lived under a far more ſevere Diſcipline, than they did at preſent; and that times were changed. The Ambaſſadours also favoured the Monks for the intereſt ſake of Princes, who deſire not that Biſhops ſhould have too much power, becauſe they many times abuſe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martin Royas Pontal Rouge</hi> Ambaſſadour from the Great Maſter and Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> was received in Congregation the ſeventh of <hi>September.</hi> Seeing every one minded their Intereſts, his chief demand was, that the Council would Ordain, that the Poſſeſſions and Commendaries, which had been taken from them ſhould be reſtored. The Legates acquainted the Pope with the demand of the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Malta,</hi> and the Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it was the buſineſs of the Council, who ought not to neglect it. In that, and the following Congregations the Articles of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were again treated of, which had been ſo many times altered and corrected by the Legates; and they afforded no important De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. The third Article regarded the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Metropolitans or Archbiſhops. Thoſe of that Character and ſuch of them as were preſent, were for having the Ancient Canons reeſtabliſhed, according to which, Biſhops were ſubject to viſitation, correction, and to the Government of Metropolitans, as Curates are ſubject to the Biſhops. Particularly <hi>Giovanni Treviſano</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Venice</hi> was mightily for the reſtitution of thoſe privileges; but the Archbiſhops were not ſtrong enough to gain their Cauſe.

That Decree contained a Preface, thirteen Chapters and a Concluſion. The Preface mentioned, that the Council had a deſign to prevent the enterpriſes of Seculars upon the Immunities of the Church, and that for that end it revived the Decrees and Holy Canons which were to be obſerved under pain of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema.</hi> It ordained then, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Churchmen ſhould not be Judged by a Secular Court, upon any pretext whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though they ſhould even conſent to it; that Secular Judges ſhould not offer to meddle with Matrimonial Cauſes, Cauſes of Hereſie, Tithes, Rights of Patronage, Benefices, nor with other Cauſes wherein any thing of the Spirituality is concerned, whether they be Civil or Criminal; that Secular Princes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Eſtabliſh Judges in Eccleſiaſtick affairs; that Secular Magiſtrates muſt not prohibit an Eccleſiaſtick Judge to proceed againſt any by Excommunication; that neither Emperour, Kings, nor Princes can make any Edicts or Ordinances concerning the Affairs, Goods and Poſſeſſions of Churchmen; that Churchmen ſhould be maintained in their Temporal Right of high, middle, and low Jurisdiction; that Eccleſaſticks ſhould not be obliged to pay any
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:99003:319"/>Taxes, Impoſts, Tenths or Subſidies; that Princes and Magiſtrates ſhould not have Power to quarter their Officers, Soldiers or Horſes, in the Houſes of Churchmen. There were a great many more Articles of the ſame force, and that tended to the ſame end. So the Clergy ſhook off the lawfull Yoke of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they owed to their Sovereigns, and erected to themſelves within their States, a temporal Juriſdiction over Chriſtians, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to that of Kings, and wholly independent of their Authority. The Concluſion contained an earneſt Exhortation to the Obſervation of theſe Decrees under the pain of <hi>Anathema.</hi> This was the Piece againſt which the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of <hi>France</hi> had orders to proteſt, if they intended to paſs it, which they failed not to doe. The Emperour wrote alſo to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Morone,</hi> that he would never ſuffer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Emperour nor Archduke, that the Council ſhould offer to make ſuch a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the prejudice of the Juriſdiction of Princes. But the Conduct of the <hi>French</hi> upon that occaſion was much more vigorous. In the Congregation of the two and twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> they had the patience to hear a long Harangue, wherein one of the Prelates ſtrove to prove, that the diſorders of the Church proceeded from Princes, and that Care muſt be taken to reform them;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> proteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Decree, and makes a Speech that cuts the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the quick.</note> that ſince the Acts concerning that were ready, there was no more to be done but to produce them. The Preſident <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> ſtarted up, and made his Proteſtation by word of mouth, in a long and witty diſcourſe, delivered briskly in words that cut to the heart. He laughed
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:99003:320"/>at all the petty Reformations which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had made for the Clergy, made a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon betwixt the Canons of the Council, and the Ancient Canons of the Diſcipline of the Primitive Church; wherein it was not permitted to Biſhops to be abſent from their Flocks three months of the year, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Council allowed: wherein Beneficiaries had not the liberty, which the Council gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to diſpoſe of the Revenues of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices to the prejudice of the Poor, to whom properly they belong. And ſo went over all the Abuſes, authoriſed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> comparing them with the Severity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diſcipline. He alledged that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Princes which was propoſed, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded directly to the Ruine of the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church; but that the King knew very well how to maintain them, that he would make uſe of his Right in laying hold on the goods of the Church when his occaſions did require it: that it was an intolerable Attempt to excommunicate Kings, even without a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as that Decree ordained; that they ſhould concern themſelves with ſpiritual matters, and not with the Affairs of Princes, with which they had nothing to doe; that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had made Ordinances in Eccleſiaſtick matters, and that the Church of <hi>France</hi> had been governed according to its Laws, above four hundred years before the Compilation of the Decretals; that Kings held their Power onely of God, and that it belongs not to Churchmen to reform them: that if they had a mind to reform Princes, they ſhould firſt think of reforming themſelves, and become
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:99003:320"/>like St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and that that would be the way to make Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imitate the Examples of the <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s, of <hi>Honorius, Arcadius,</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians.</hi> This Harangue put the Council out of all patience, and even the <hi>French</hi> Prelates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: there aroſe a murmuring and confuſed Noiſe amongſt them, which was like to have broken out into ſome ſcandalous Tranſport, had not the Legates to prevent it diſmiſſed the Aſſembly. The Biſhops ſpoke all the Evil they could deviſe againſt his Speech, to make it paſs for Heretical: and <hi>Nicolas Pelue</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> and <hi>Jerome de la Souchieres</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clervaux,</hi> had big words with <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> about it. They reported every where that that Proteſtation was made without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King, that <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> was a Creature of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that he was ſuſpected of Hereſie, and that he ought to be put into the Inquiſition. Others had ſcraped together ſome Notes of that Harangue; but becauſe <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> found them falſe, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it himſelf, and ſent a copy of it to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with a Letter wherein he told him that he could not abandon the Royal Authority, which for the ſpace of four hundred years had been attempted upon by the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> that as a <hi>Frenchman</hi> and a Member of Parliament, he was obliged to aſſert the Rights of his King, and the opinions of his Faculty: And that it was not juſt, that the Council, made up of the ſlaves of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould be Judge in its own Cauſe. So ſoon as <hi>Du Ferrier</hi>'s Speech appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in publick, the Council cauſed it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:99003:321"/>by a nameleſs Authour. <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> made his defence, and inſtead of recanting, he confirmed all that he had ſaid, or written. Theſe Writings encreaſed the Provocation, and the Biſhops revenged themſelves by reviling, not ſo much the Ambaſſadours, as the Court of <hi>France.</hi> They accuſed the Queen Mother of openly favouring the Hereticks. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that ſhe was governed by the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillons</hi> who were declared Hereticks, by the Chancellour <hi>de l'Hopital,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> who were ſuſpected of Hereſie. After that Proteſtation the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours goe to <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </note> having ſtaid a Fourtnight longer at <hi>Trent,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the Orders they had from Court. Before they went away they declared to the few <hi>French</hi> Prelates that remained, that it was the King's Intention they ſhould oppoſe the fifth and ſixth Articles of Reformation, which were propoſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Articles drew the Cauſes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Biſhops out of the Kingdom; whereas according to the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, the Members of the Clergy ought to be judged <hi>primâ inſtantiâ</hi> upon the place, and by their immediate Superiours.</p>
                  <p>When the news of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour's Proteſtation came to <hi>Rome,</hi> it cauſed great heart-burnings in the Pope's Court. No man was ſo much afflicted as the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> becauſe it was an unlucky accident that brought great Prejudice to the Negotiation that he was a managing with the Pope for the Grandeur of himſelf and Family. He paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Pope the beſt he could, blaming the Ambaſſadours, and promiſing to write to the
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:99003:321"/>King that he might procure reparation of that Scandal. He did, indeed, write, and in ſuch terms as well diſcovered that he had ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Intereſts of his King, and the opinions of his Countrey, to the deſign of pleaſing the Pope, whom he would engage in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concerns. The Pope wrote alſo to <hi>Trent,</hi> that they ſhould ſtill goe on, and that if the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours had a mind to be gone, they ſhould not hinder them, but withall, give them no occaſion of withdrawing; that after all, they ſhould prepare to hold the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion immediately upon the return of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and put an end to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; that now he had got the better of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and that none but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remained to be overcome.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> not onely croſſed the Pope's deſign of ſhortning the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but alſo made it his buſineſs to obtain an Alteration of the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis.</hi> He continually charged a freſh, and never left off ſoliciting Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> even amidſt the troubles that were occaſioned by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the <hi>French,</hi> till, at length, the Cardinal was fain to promiſe that they ſhould endeavour to give him ſatisfaction in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seſſion; what this ſatisfaction was we ſhall ſee hereafter. The Legates being preſſed by the Biſhops, who were not baulked by the Proteſtation of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed again the Decree of the Reformation of Princes: but all the other Ambaſſadours op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, ſo that the Council was obliged to refer it to the following Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Pope being incenſed at the Proteſtation
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:99003:322"/>of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours had a mind to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon the faction, from which he thought it came. He therefore reſolved to purſue the affair that had been commenced againſt the five <hi>French</hi> Biſhops,<note place="margin">The Pope has a mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt five <hi>French</hi> Biſhops ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Hereſie, and againſt the Queen of <hi>Navarre.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it.</note> whom he had cauſed to be cited before the Tribunal of the Inquiſition. He was likewiſe for continuing the Procedures againſt the Queen of <hi>Navarre:</hi> and therefore on the thirteenth of <hi>October</hi> he cauſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be publiſhed againſt the five Biſhops, and a ſevere Monitory affixed on publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt <hi>Jean</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> for depriving her of her Dignities, States and Dominions. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> told the Pope, that theſe Procedures were abſolutely contrary to the Maxims of <hi>France,</hi> the Liberties of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church, and that therefore the King would take it ill that he had proceeded to ſentence againſt Biſhops <hi>primâ inſtantiâ,</hi> and far worſe, that he deprived a Queen and his Allye of her Dominions; but the Cardinal repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this faintly and onely for faſhion, that he might not be accuſed of combining with the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſo evident an Invaſion of the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. As the Cardinal had no deſign to perſwade, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he perſwade, and they proceeded notwithſtanding his Remonſtrances. But the King of <hi>France</hi> employed more prevalent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; for the <hi>Sieur d'Oyſel</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> by Orders from his Maſter ſpoke to the Pope about thoſe two affairs with a great deal of reſolution. He told him, that the King would never ſuffer, that contrary to the Prerogatives of the Majeſty of Kings, he
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:99003:322"/>ſhould proceed to the ſpoiling and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating a Widow-Queen, whoſe Husband was killed in the Wars againſt the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who was his Allye, and who had moſt of her Lands in <hi>France;</hi> that if he went on any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the King his Maſter would take the Courſe his Anceſtours had done. And as to the buſineſs of the five Biſhops, that the way of proceeding againſt them was abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Cuſtoms of <hi>France,</hi> which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not that Biſhops ſhould be judged any where but upon the place, and by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Superiours. <hi>D'Oyſel</hi> ſucceeded ſo well in his Negotiation, that he obtained the Pope's word that there ſhould be no more talk, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> nor of the five Biſhops. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> got no great Satisfaction by his writing to the King about <hi>Du Ferrier</hi>'s Speech, and the Proteſtation of the Ambaſſadours; for the Court of <hi>France</hi> approved the Conduct of the Ambaſſadours in all they had done, and ordered them to ſtay at <hi>Venice</hi> untill new orders. The King wrote alſo to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and let him know that he did not take it well that he had written to him as he did; and to make it appear upon the ſpot how much the King ſlighted the Enterpriſes of the Council, he proceeded to the Alienation of Church-Livings, without ſtaying for the Pope's conſent. He cauſed a Sale of them to be made to the Value of two Millions five hundred thouſand <hi>Livres,</hi> and at a very cheap rate. Amongſt others the Temporal Juriſdiction, which till then the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> had over that City, was purchaſed to the King for thirty thouſand <hi>Livres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="568" facs="tcp:99003:323"/>All this while the Legates continued the Synodal Actions at <hi>Trent.</hi> They removed ſome difficulties which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill made about the Articles of Reformation: for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops inſiſted particularly on that which related to the Exemption of Chapters, whereby they pretended not to be ſubject to the Authority of the Ordinaries. The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Churches of <hi>Spain</hi> had an Agent at the Council, who ſolicited the Preſervation of their Privileges. The Legates favoured them for the Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi> depend much leſs on the Pope, than the Canons doe; for, moſt part of the Biſhopricks are in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the King, whereas the Diſpoſal of the Canonſhips is almoſt wholly in the Power of the Pope. The Count <hi>de Luna</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared openly againſt the Chapters, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that if the Biſhops had not ſatisfaction given them as to thoſe and ſome other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and their Demands granted; he would ſtop their coming to the Seſſion. This menace obliged the Legates to refer that Article to the following Seſſion, and, in the mean time, the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> commanded the Deputies of the Chapters inſtantly to be gone. No more difficulty remained, but about the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis</hi> againſt which the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> declared open War. The Legates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to himſelf, and told him that he ſhould alter that Clauſe in what manner he pleaſed; but he refuſing to take it upon him, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> came from <hi>Rome</hi> in the very nick of time, and cleared all the Scruples: for he hit upon a way of ſatisfying
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:99003:323"/>the Count by this canting Explication, that by the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis,</hi> it was not the deſign to make any Innovation in the manner of proceeding in Ancient Councils. And a Chapter was thereupon made at the end of the Decree of General Reformation. This difficulty being taken away, all conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Decrees; and the Seſſion was held.</p>

                     </note>On the Eleventh of <hi>November,</hi> when after the uſual Ceremonies, and the reading of ſome Letters from Princes, and Ambaſſadours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, the Chapters of Doctrine about Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, with the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s that were tackt to them, were read. The Article concerning Clandeſtine Marriages, was again conteſted, and put to the Vote; but moſt part of the Votes were, for leaving it as they had found it. The Chapter of Reformation of the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Marriage being read, next came the Chapter of General Reformation. So ſoon as it was read over, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated the Declaration which he had made in the Congregation the day before, that he approved the Decrees, provided they did no prejudice to the Privileges, Rights and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> He ſaid far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the <hi>French</hi> Nation accepted them not as a perfect Reformation; but as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to a more ample Reformation which they expected from the Pope. Theſe Decrees are too long to be inſerted into this Hiſtory. They contain twelve <hi>Anathema</hi>'s againſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Doctrine concerning Marriage, ten Chapters of a particular Reformation about the ſame matter of Marriage, twenty Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:99003:324"/>relating to General Reformation, and an one and twentieth, which was added for the interpretation of the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> There is nothing to be found in all theſe Articles that tends to a General Reformation, ſuch as the People demanded; but rather the Pope's Yoke upon the Clergy, and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's upon the People was made heavier. In the fifth Chapter of the General Reformation, the Pope reſerves to himſelf the Cogniſance of all Criminal Cauſes of Biſhops, which are called the greater, taking them from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, and Provincial Synods. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ordains, that when the Pope ſhall give any one a Commiſſion <hi>in partibus,</hi> that Commiſſion ſhall onely extend to the taking of Informations. In the twelfth Canon about Marriage; the Council pronounces <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe who ſhall deny that the Tryal of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Cauſes belongs to the Church. Some who pretend to a little skill in Antiquity, could not but obſerve, that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo; that all Laws concerning Marriage had been made by Emperours; and that the Cauſes which did ariſe from thoſe Laws were tryed by the ſecular Magiſtrates. Nay, more, its known that ſome <hi>Gothick</hi> Kings gave Diſpenſations for forbidden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and in the Formularies of <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> the ſtyle of theſe Diſpenſations is ſtill to be ſeen. There were ſome who expected ſome good from the fourteenth Chapter of the General Reformation, which revokes, cancells, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuls and Conſtitutions or Cuſtomes, of paying any thing for the purchaſe of Titles and the poſſeſſion of Benefices: they were in hopes
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:99003:324"/>that that Article, if rightly interpreted, would overthrow the <hi>Annats</hi> which are pay'd to the Pope, for the taking poſſeſſion of Benefices; but experience hath evinced that that was the wrong way of interpreting the Decree. The Eighth Chapter ordains, that they who have ſinned publickly, ſhould make publick repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and it was hoped that that would be an advance towards the ancient Diſcipline. But there is a Clauſe rarely well put in, <hi>ni ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Epiſcopo videatur,</hi> for it hath not as yet ſeemed good to the Biſhops, to doe any thing in Execution of that Decree. They who are jealous of the rights of Princes, and ſecular Magiſtrates, beſides what we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, did not take it well that the Council in the ſixth Chapter of the Reformation of Marriage, ſhould ordain, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers a Woman ſhall give her a Portion whether he Marry her or not; for they looked upon that as a mere civil Conſtitution, that cannot come under the Cogniſance of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Judge. Thoſe who had no great kindneſs for the Council, and ſought to make themſelves merry at its coſt, laughed a little at the Canon which prohibits Clandeſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; becauſe it pronounceth an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe who deny that theſe Marriages are true Sacraments, and yet ſubjoins, that the Church hath always deteſted them. This ſeemed to be an odd Clinch; that the Church ſhould declare, ſhe deteſted true Sacraments. The one and twentieth Chapter about the Clauſe <hi>proponentibus legatis</hi> made ſport alſo for a great many. The Chapter declared, that by that Clauſe there was no deſign of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:99003:325"/>any thing in the manner that had been obſerved in ancient Councils, nor of giving or taking from any one any right contrary to ancient Conſtitutions. When all was done, the Council at a concluſion, and that the Legates had drawn all the advantage from this Clauſe, that they could expect, they come in at laſt with a Declaration, that it was not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, forſooth, to doe prejudice to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This could not paſs without a remark, that it looked very like the man's excuſe, who having given another a box on the Ear, ſaid that he had not done it with an intention to offend him. It was obſerved that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Pope had found out an excellent way to keep Councils in Bondage; that there was no more to be done, but in the beginning to make ſuch a Clauſe as this, let the Members quarrel about it during the whole ſitting of the Council, and then declare in the end, when the buſineſs is done, that it was not thereby deſigned to reſtrain any man's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Council precipitates to its end, the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppoſe it.</note>We are now at length come to the actions which immediately went before the laſt Seſſion. The countenance of affairs is now much to be altered: no more of thoſe long delays, that held all <hi>Europe</hi> in ſuſpence; the Council joggs not on fair and ſoft to its end, it runs poſt, precipitates, and all conſpire to a concluſion. The Pope ſtoops under the Burthen of the Council; he intends upon any terms to ſhake it off: the <hi>French</hi> who expect no more from that Aſſembly, follow the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that hath ſtruck in with the Pope. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> abandon the Council, as a Patient paſt
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:99003:325"/>hopes of recovery: and none remain but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would march on gravely, and ſtep by ſtep in the reſt, as they had done all along till then. But they are not able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone not reſiſt that torrent of impatience which hurried the Council to its end. There remained ſtill to be handled the matters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Worſhip of Saints, Purgatory, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Faſts: and that was enough to have employed the Council for ſeveral years, after the rate that the former Points were managed. The matter of Indulgences alone, would have taken up the Council for ſeveral Months, if it had been examined, as the Point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, but all was diſpatched in a fortnights time.</p>
                  <p>That they might attain to this ſpeedy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, the Legates and Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> agreed together, that all which remained ſhould be diſpatched in one Seſſion. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and Imperial Ambaſſadours undertook to prepare the Members for it, by ſpreading of Reports that the Emperour deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it might be concluded before <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> were to depart in the Month of <hi>December;</hi> that therefore mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ought to be ſo ordered, that all things ſhould be expeded before their departure. They who were weary of their ſtay at <hi>Trent,</hi> received the news with all imaginable Joy: and on the fifteenth of <hi>November</hi> Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> aſſembled at his houſe a Cabal of the Council, and deſired the Prelates to give their opinions as to the Concluſion of it that was ſo wiſhed for. All conſented to it, except the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain;</hi> but the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:99003:326"/>Legates were reſolved to ſtep over all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Decree which was minuted by the Clergy for the Reformation of Princes, and againſt which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours had proteſted, was one of the moſt tickliſh Points. The Legates therefore reſolved to let that alone, and yet to doe ſomewhat for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Clergy; which was, that revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ancient Canons without ſpecifying them, they ſhould put in an exhortation to Princes to preſerve the Church in her privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and even to make reſtitution of the rights which had been uſurped upon the Clergy by ſecular Judges. But no <hi>Anathema</hi>'s nor threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were added, they onely made uſe of terms full of reſpect to Sovereigns. The Pope having well conſulted the matter of <hi>Rome,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it to paſs ſo. The Council held dayly two Congregations; and the Legates obliged the Members to be very ſhort in giving their opinions. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who deſired not the concluſion, took their full ſwing, they did not put themſelves to the rack, but even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their diſcourſes with deſign to gain time, and to prolong the Council, untill they might have Orders from the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The ſixth Article of Reformation propoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former Seſſion, had been referred to this: and that Article concerned the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chapters of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour and the Biſhops of that Nation were their Parties, and their Deputy after he had been ordered by the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> was forced to be gone. But the Legates were good Advocates for them, and being aſſured of the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Italians,</hi> they were in
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:99003:326"/>a fair way of gaining their Cauſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were abſent. Yet the Council found out a means by giving ſome augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Biſhops Authority over the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but a great deal leſs than they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The reſolution of demanding the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council from the Pope.</note>In the Congregation of the twentieth of <hi>November</hi> the queſtion was debated, whether they ſhould demand of the Pope the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Decrees of the Council. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> maintained, that it was not neceſſary, ſaying that the Fathers in the ſixteenth Seſſion, which was the laſt held under <hi>Julius</hi> III. demanded not the Pope's Confirmation, that if they did not imitate their Conduct, it would be thought they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto,</hi> who had always his eyes in his head for the preſervation of the Authority of the Pope, replyed that the Fathers of the Council at that time made it ſufficiently appear, that they held the Confirmation of the Pope to be neceſſary, becauſe they commanded not the obſervation of the Canons which they had made; but onely exhorted to it. That opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion prevailed without difficulty: but there remained ſtill a ſcruple, to wit, whether they ſhould ſtay for the Pope's Anſwer at <hi>Trent,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had demanded his Confirmation, or otherwiſe whether upon concluding the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil it ſhould be demanded of the Pope, and ſo break up immediately, without expecting an Anſwer. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> whoſe two Predominant Paſſions were, to diſpatch, and to pleaſe the Pope, was of the laſt opinion: and there is nothing more clear, than that this
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:99003:327"/>Cardinal and the <hi>French</hi> who were of the mind that the Confirmation of the Decrees of the Council ſhould be demanded of the Pope, did exceedingly forget themſelves. They had kept a great clutter to hinder that the Pope ſhould be declared Superiour to a Council, and yet all of a ſudden they betray their own Cauſe by the greateſt weakneſs in the World. For to demand the Pope's Confirmation of the Council, is a Declaration plain enough that it is inferiour to him; no Superiour Court ever demanding the Confirmation of its Decrees from an inferiour. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who would have all things make for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour of the Council, or rather for the greater ſatisfaction of the Pope, eſſayed to bring back to <hi>Trent,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours that were at <hi>Venice:</hi> but they would not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that though the Chapter of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Princes was revoked, yet many other things had paſſed in the Council to the prejudice of the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the Preſident <hi>du Ferrier</hi> would not by his preſence countenance thoſe bad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations. When the matter of Reformation was digeſted into the Method that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have it in, the Legates applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Doctrine; and the Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Cardinal of <hi>Warmia,</hi> and eight other Prelates to frame the Decree concerning Purgatory, the Invocation of Saints, Relicks and Images; they all jumpt in one deſign, not to ſtart any Controverſie that might retard them. Nevertheleſs, they found themſelves a little puzled about the Article of Purgatory; for ſome were for having the place determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:99003:327"/>where this Purgatory is, as the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> had done, and that it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined that the Pains which are ſuffered there are the Torments of Fire. Others objected that all Divines agreed not as to that, and that if they ſhould offer to make a Deciſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, they could not avoid falling into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates which they were willing to ſhun: ſo that they were of opinion to make uſe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, and to enjoyn Biſhops to ſee that that Doctrine ſhould be carefully taught; and this opinion was followed. There was no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about the Point of the Invocation of Saints; there was ſomewhat more in relation to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, touching the nature of the Worſhip that is due to them, but it went not far.</p>

In that Reviſal there were but a few matters altered: By the third Chapter of this Reformation, all the Monaſteries of <hi>Mendicant</hi> Friers were allowed to enjoy Lands and immoveable Poſſeſſions, notwithſtanding the Rule of their Inſtitution, which forbids them to poſſeſs any thing in proper.

                     </note>All difficulties being ſurmounted, on <hi>Friday</hi> the third of <hi>December,</hi> the Prelates and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours went to Church with the uſual Ceremonies. <hi>Jerome Ragazzone</hi> Titular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Nazianzo,</hi> made the Sermon in praiſe of the Council, and recapitulated the good Laws and Ordinances which were made in it. After the Ceremonies were over, they read the Decrees concerning Purgatory, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and Invocation of Saints, Images and their Worſhip. They alſo read the Decree
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:99003:328"/>for Reformation of Monks, containing twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chapters, to which they added an one and twentieth for a ſhield to the Pope's Authority, leſt by inadvertency, it might be wounded in ſome of the Canons of Reformation, and to leave him in full liberty to diſpenſe with all the Canons. The Council therefore declares in it, that all the Decrees have been made with intention, that the Authority of the Holy See ſhould remain ſafe and inviolate without the leaſt encroachment upon it. When this was done, becauſe it was very late, the reſt was deferred till next day. In this ſecond day they read the Decrees concerning Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the Choice of Meats, Faſts and Holy days. They made and Act of Reference to the Pope, about the <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> Miſſals, Breviaries, Ceremonials and the Care of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Catechiſm. At length the Council cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Act to be read, which declared that the Places that had been aſſigned to Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, ought not to be any ways prejudicial to the Rights and Privileges of Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, whom the Council pretended to leave in the ſame condition as they were before.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſembly was concluded with Volleys of Acclamations to the Praiſe of the Pope, Emperour, Kings, Legates, and the Fathers. Heretofore in Ancient Councils, theſe Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations or Benedictions, were made in a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming confuſed manner, with a low Voice. But at <hi>Trent</hi> they would have the matter perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in its Formalities. It was written down, read, and ſung after the manner of <hi>Antiphones.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> pronounced the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:99003:329"/>and the Prelates anſwered. This action of the Cardinal was extremely played upon. It could not be imagined that he with all his Dignities,<note place="margin">A mean Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.</hi>
                     </note> and large Characters, would have condeſcended to diſcharge the Office of a Deacon or Chanter. It was lookt upon as a low and mean Carriage: but the <hi>French</hi> had a worſe opinion of it; for beſides the baſeneſs of the action, they lookt upon it as a Crime of State, becauſe in the Acclamations, there was no expreſs mention made of the King of <hi>France;</hi> for which the Cardinal was ſeverely checkt upon his return. At length, all was ſumm'd up with an <hi>Anathema,</hi> pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hereticks in General. The Council conſulted whether they ſhould not expreſly Anathematiſe <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and the other Heads of Parties, as had heretofore been practiſed in the Caſe of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and other Hereticks. But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and Imperial Ambaſſadours oppoſed that, repreſenting that the Princes were rather the Heads of the Parties in that affair, than the Teachers; that it would offend them, and oblige them to make Leagues together againſt the Catholick Religion. The Council acquieſced to that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and reſted ſatisfied with a General <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</hi> All the Prelates were commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Excommunication to ſign the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees before they went away, which was done on <hi>Sunday.</hi> They were ſigned by two hundred fifty and five Hands, four Legates, two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, three Patriarchs, five and twenty Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, an hundred fifty and eight Biſhops, ſeven Abbots, thirty nine Proxies for Abſents, and ſeven Generals of Orders. The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:99003:329"/>had been enjoined to ſign alſo; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe of <hi>France</hi> were not there, and their Hands not being amongſt the reſt, it would have been a Declaration that they refuſed to acknowledge the Council: all the reſt were therefore diſpenſed with no to ſign, upon Pretext that it had not been the Cuſtome of Ancient Councils.</p>
                  <p>This laſt Seſſion of the Council gave as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfaction as the reſt hand done; for after all the fair promiſes of ſetting about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, there was nothing found that could anſwer the Expectations of People. The nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of General Reformation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very Chriſtian Decree, againſt Duels, which were prohibited under very ſevere Penalties. Nevertheleſs, it was obſerved, that the Council herein encroached upon the Right of Kings; for it declared the Emperour, all Kings, Princes and Lords, who ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Duels, to be excommunicated, and deprived of the Dominion of the Place holding of the Church, wherein Duels ſhould be fought. It was not thought in the Power of a mere Eccleſiaſtick Judicature, to deprive Sovereign Princes of their Territories and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Poſſeſſions, nor to lay Commands upon them under pain of Excommunication. The Permiſſion which the Council granted to <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants</hi> to enjoy Lands and Real Eſtates, was ſo far from paſſing for an Article of Reformation, that it was lookt upon as a great Corruption, and as a fair means put into the hands of Monks to hook in the remainder of the Eſtates of Chriſtendom, whereof they already enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the largeſt ſhare. In general, few were
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:99003:330"/>ſatisfied with the Acts of the Council. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were diſpleaſed at the precipitant manner and hurry of concluding it, without acquainting their King, and expecting his anſwer. But <hi>France</hi> more than all others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they found therein many things which overthrew the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. Preſident <hi>Du Ferrier</hi> during his ſtay at <hi>Venice,</hi> made it his buſineſs to make a Collection of them; and upon the return of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> the Cardinal was ſeverely cenſured for having ſuffered ſo many things to paſs contrary to the Sentiments, and Cuſtoms of the Church of <hi>France.</hi> It was objected to him, that after he had vigorouſly aſſerted the Superiority of a Council over the Pope, yet at length he had baſely betrayed the Cauſe, ſeeing he had ſubſcribed to the firſt Chapter of the General Reformation, which grants the Pope <hi>Adminiſtrationem Eccleſiae,</hi> the Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Church Univerſal. It was alſo thought, that the opinion of the Pope's Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over a Council, was ſufficiently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the laſt Chapter, which declares that all things have been decreed, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Authority of the Pope, which is an evident raiſing of the Authority of the Holy See, above that of the Decrees. And above all, it was thought that by demanding from the Pope the Confirmation of the Council, they had placed his Holineſs above a Council. It was likewiſe objected as a fault to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that in the one and twentieth Chapter of the General Reformation, he had ſuffered the preſent Council to be declared the ſame with that which was held under
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:99003:330"/>
                     <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> III. after that <hi>France</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much pains, to have that Aſſembly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a new Council. But the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a particular manner complained that he had ſuffered the Authority of the King's Judges to be trampled under foot; ſeeing the Council had ſo far enlarged the Power of Churchmen as made a conſiderable breach in the Civil Juriſdiction. As for inſtance, it allows Biſhops to proceed againſt Laicks by Pecuniary Fines, and Impriſonments. Theſe oppoſitions that the Council met with in <hi>France,</hi> were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delightfull to thoſe who were ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and Catholicks themſelves took Liberty to ſpeak. The whole Diſcourſe both of Catholicks and Proteſtants, was about the Debates and Factions in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Affairs, eſpecially the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And according to the <hi>French</hi> way of raillery, it was preſently in every body's mouth; that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had far more Authority than that of the Apoſtles; for whereas the Apoſtles ſaid, It ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us: the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaid barely, It hath ſeemed good to us, quite excluding the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Germany</hi> ſlighted the Council to the higheſt Degree; for the Prelates of that Nation had not been preſent in this laſt Convocation, which notwithſtanding was the moſt Solemn of all. Very few Biſhops were there for the Kingdoms if <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> none at all from <hi>England, Swedeland, Danemark,</hi> and the low Countries. The <hi>French</hi> Prelates came onley at the latter end, and reckoning them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they did not exceed
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:99003:331"/>the number of forty Biſhops; all the reſt were <hi>Italians:</hi> of a few more than two hundred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, which made up the Council, there were above an hundred and fifty from <hi>Italy.</hi> And therefore it had the Name of the Council of the Pope and <hi>Italians.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by a Bull.</note>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was very glad that the Council was ended; they mattered not much what Decrees it had made, provided it could make no more. The Pope died not then of his ſickneſs, and had double Cauſe of rejoicing at the ſame time, both that he had recovered his health, and was alſo diſcharged of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Council. He was ſo overjoyed, that without boggling, he declared that he would confirm it, and even add ſome new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations. That Declaration allarmed the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> though the Reformations of the Council went not very far; however no body was willing to part from any of their Rents and Profits: and that nevertheleſs they muſt have done, had the Decrees of the Council been religiouſly obſerved. Moſt of the Cardinals were of opinion, that the Pope ſhould moderate the Articles which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them; and alledged that that would ſerve for two ends. Firſt, it would, as we have ſaid, eaſe them of ſeveral incommodious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations: and then it would confirm the Pope in his Superiority over the Council by refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it. But, in fine, after that a great many Congregations of Cardinals had been held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject, the opinion of confirming it without any alteration prevailed. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Pope to it, by Arguments of Piety,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:99003:331"/>Honour and Sincerity to his word. But the deciding Caſt was put in by <hi>Hugo Boncompag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vieſte</hi> in <hi>Apulia.</hi> He alledged that the Confirmation of the Council, was ſo far from diminiſhing the Authority of the Pope, and the Grandure of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it would much advance it, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Barriere were ſet to put a ſtop to the Raſhneſs of Doctours, and hinder them from interpreting the Council, according to their ſeveral Fancies, and Intereſts. It was his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then, that the Judges themſelves ſhould be prohibited from medling with the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Senſe of the Council, and that it ſhould be ordained that in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matters, recourſe ſhould be had to the Holy See, and its Interpretations ſubmitted to. And thus he made it appear, that by ſo doeing, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would always have the abſolute Diſpoſal of every thing that pinched them, becauſe in confirming the Council, the Holy See reſerved to it ſelf the Power of interpreting it. He ſaid, that there was no Law ſo plain and expreſs, nor ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, which might not be turned to a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and a favourable Senſe, by means of Exceptions and Qualifications. If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing then, in the Council, that pinches the Holy See, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it will be a very eaſie matter to avoid it by expounding it, as one pleaſes. But the Council cannot be made uſe of, ſaid he, to the Prejudice of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe all the force of its Execution will depend on the Holy See, to which recourſe muſt be had for Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Overture was worth a Cardinals
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:99003:332"/>Cap to the Biſhop, and it appeared ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and good, that all agreed to it. Thus the matter was reſolved upon, and the Pope on the ſix and twentieth of <hi>December</hi> gave the Bull of Confirmation, wherein he forbids under pain of Excommunication, the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Commentaries, or Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Council; ordaining in all doubtfull Caſes, Recourſe to be had to the Holy See. Within ſome Months after the Pope made a Promotion of Nineteen Cardinals, to reward thoſe who had faithfully ſerved him in the Council; and neither <hi>Marco Antonio Colonna</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Taranto,</hi> nor the Biſhop of <hi>Vieſte</hi> were forgotten.</p>
